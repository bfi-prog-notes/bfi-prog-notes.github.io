The Programme Notes are compiled by the Documentation Editors in the BFI's [Data and Digital Preservation department](https://www2.bfi.org.uk/explore-film-tv/bfi-national-archive/about-bfi-national-archive/archive-teams/data-team).

They use content from the BFI's [Sight and Sound](https://www.bfi.org.uk/sight-and-sound) magazine - and its predecessor [Monthly Film Bulletin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monthly_Film_Bulletin) - as well as production notes from filmmakers.

The aim is to provide a programme note for every screening in the cinemas at BFI Southbank, but occasionally there is no suitable content that we can use for a screening.

Sometimes the notes contain spoilers that give away important information about the film's narrative, and in those cases you'll see a SPOILER warning at the start of the text.
