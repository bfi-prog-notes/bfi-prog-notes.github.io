The Programme Notes are compiled by the Documentation Editors in the BFI's [Data and Digital Preservation department](https://www2.bfi.org.uk/explore-film-tv/bfi-national-archive/about-bfi-national-archive/archive-teams/data-team).

They use content from the BFI's [Sight and Sound](https://www.bfi.org.uk/sight-and-sound) magazine - and its predecessor [Monthly Film Bulletin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Monthly_Film_Bulletin) - as well as production notes from filmmakers.
