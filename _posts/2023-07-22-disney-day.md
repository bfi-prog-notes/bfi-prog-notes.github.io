**Sadeen Elyas** is a PhD candidate in Film Musicology at the University of Hull. Her research interests are film music (including the early use of sound in Hollywood cinema), animation studies, especially Disney, and the relationship between food and music in films.

She has published an academic chapter on Disney’s _Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs_’ film music.

In addition to her academic pursuits, Sadeen Elyas is a dedicated Saudi musician and composer. She enjoys blending Western and Arabic musical styles, incorporating elements of classical and Disney music into her own compositions. Sadeen has collaborated with various organisations, creating music for projects that address social issues.

Over Chris’ time at MPC he’s worked his way through artist to Lead, to HOD and is currently Head of Creative for MPC overseeing all projects and supporting Heads of Departments. The public reaction and enjoyment of seeing beloved characters on the big screen is fundamentally what drives Chris’ passion to work within the VFX industry, also the community and artistic family within our digital world, along side the recent advancements in technological and creative workflows provide fuel for maintaining Chris’ drive – every new project brings new challenges which supplies never-ending opportunities to create emotive and artist centric movies.
