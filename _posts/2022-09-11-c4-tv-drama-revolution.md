On 2 November 1982, Channel 4’s opening night schedule included two dramas. At 8pm, the channel transmitted the opening episode of its new  soap opera, _Brookside_. Then at 9pm, in the first ever Film on Four slot, came _Walter_, a film written by David Cook, starring Ian McKellen, and directed by Stephen Frears.

Film on Four and _Brookside_ were to remain the two dominant TV drama commissions of Channel 4’s early years. _Brookside_ was in fact the only major investment in a TV drama series. Chief Executive Jeremy Isaacs and Head of Fiction David Rose (Fiction not Drama, note) favoured the single play over TV series. This was controversial at the time. The BBC had taken the opposite route. It was cutting back on its single play output in favour of a greater investment in drama series and serials. There was huge scepticism within the BBC and ITV about Film on Four’s intention to release their films in UK cinemas before showing them on television. Other than _Brookside_, the main TV Drama events on Channel 4 were two annual seasons of Film on Four premieres on television. (There was other drama – singles and series – coming out of C4’s innovative Multicultural and Workshop departments.)

It was in fact the success of Film on Four in cinemas that led to a need to commission other strands of TV Drama. Against all expectation, audiences in the UK started to queue up at the cinema for new British movies like _Letter to Brezhnev_, _Mona_ _Lisa_ and _My Beautiful Laundrette_ (1985), all original and entertaining portraits of the UK in the 1980s with something fresh to say.  The case of _My Beautiful Laundrette_, written by Hanif Kureishi and directed by Stephen Frears, was particularly significant. It became a global success. Distributors around the world became interested in investing in Film on Four but demanded a much greater window between the films being shown in cinemas and on television. The window moved from two months to two years.

The Channel faced a shortage of drama to schedule over the coming years.  
A Commissioning Editor for Drama Series was appointed (Peter Ansorge), and the channel began to commission four new major drama series a year, alongside _Brookside_ and Film on Four.

A Very British Coup (1988) was the first success. A three-parter, based on the novel by Chris Mullin and adapted for television by Alan Plater. It begins with a newly elected Labour Government in the UK, led by Harry Perkins, determined to lead the country into a positive era of socialist reform. Harry’s policies provoke the Tory minority opposition, together with MI5, into plotting a coup. The project began as a screenplay for Film on Four. The producers were unable to raise the finance as potential co-producers, particularly in America, did not believe that such a localised UK political story could succeed in  the cinema.

Alan Plater (1935 – 2010) was one of the UK’s leading TV writers, and the opportunity to convert _A Very British Coup_ into a television series brought out the genius in him. The three episodes observes our politics – both left and right – with authenticity, humour, and an accuracy that audiences in both the UK and the US acknowledged. Rarely has a political leader come as alive on screen as Ray McAnally’s Harry Perkins – humane, purposeful, and able to outwit each and every opposition MP and hostile journalist who crosses his path. He is the Labour leader we’ve all dreamed of but never yet elected.  _A_ _Very British Coup_ was made and transmitted at the height of the Thatcher years and became, on one level, the political fairy tale for which we had all been waiting. On seeing it, the Greek prime minister, Ioannis Grivas, announced: ‘I am Harry Perkins.’ Director Mick Jackson brought a pace and dynamism to the direction that was also new to a UK political thriller.

Traffik  (1989) A six-part drugs thriller, written by Simon Moore, that crosses three continents and countries. _Traffik_ begins in the poppy fields of Pakistan where the crop is grown and converted into heroin, it then moves to Hamburg, Germany where the drug is distributed, and finally to London where the drug is bought and consumed on the streets. Bill Paterson memorably plays a Tory Home Secretary whose daughter becomes a heroin addict. Lindsay Duncan is the Hamburg drug distributor, an icy and enticing performance from an actor then new to television. Jamal Shah plays the Pakistan poppy grower, Fazal, who travels from Pakistan to London seeking revenge.

_Traffik_ was the first TV drama series to incorporate three separate storylines and sets of characters into a single narrative which only comes together in the final episode. The series was an inspiration for Stephen Soderbergh’s Hollywood Oscar-winning movie _Traffic_. David Simon is on record saying that the UK’s multi-story _Traffik_ was a big influence on _The Wire_.

GBH  (1991) Robert Lindsay is outstanding as Michael Murray, the Labour leader of a far-left near-criminal local council in the North of England. Michael Palin plays a headmaster of a school for special needs in the same town. Lindsay and Palin clash when Michael Murray organises a general strike in the town, and Palin refuses to close his school. As the author of _Boys from the Blackstuff_, Alan Bleasdale was at first criticised for his negative approach to ‘old’ Labour. But _GBH_ grows into something broader and more original than a straight political drama. It’s a study of the breakdown of our politics. As the episodes develop Murray becomes increasingly unhinged and out-of-control. We start to engage with Murray and the deep flaws in his character, rather like Walter White in _Breaking Bad_. While the Michael Palin character, Jim Nelson, a character on the decent side of Labour policy, turns into a much tougher character than the one we met in episode one of the series.

Typically, from Bleasdale there is also a large amount of humour. The ‘wooing’ scenes between Robert Lindsay and Lindsay Duncan, a secret service agent up from London dedicated to Murray’s downfall, are unforgettable. _GBH_ remains one of Channel 4’s most successful and memorable original drama series. Viewers on All4 are still writing enthusiastic thank-you letters to Bleasdale today.

Tales of the City (1993) Channel 4 fully funded the first season of Armistead Maupin’s stories of sexual encounters in the San Francisco of the mid-1970s.  
It was the first time ever that a UK broadcaster commissioned an American drama series.

The US producer Alan Pool, who went on after _Tales_ to produce _Six Feet_ _Under_ for HBO says this: ‘The role Channel 4 played in creating _Tales_ cannot be overstated. Initially the plan was to do a 13-hour adaptation that would be funded half by Channel 4 and half by an American broadcaster. The American side failed to materialise – no network or cable channel would touch the material. Instead of backing out, Channel 4 committed to fully funding a six-hour adaptation, even with no guaranteed American sale.

‘Channel 4’s one stipulation was that we hire a British director. We watched the work of many contenders but the one that stood out was C4’s _Traffik_ directed by Alastair Reid. After meeting Alastair and learning of his passion for Armistead’s book, his fascination with magical realism, and his all-embracing love of the characters, we knew we had our director.’

_Tales of the City_ debuted on PBS on 10 January 1994: ‘It garnered,’ writes Pool, ‘The highest rating for a drama programme in PBS’s history. _Tales of the City_ forever changed the landscape of television, paving the way for the domestic lesbians of _Ellen_, the straight girl/gay/boy antics of _Will & Grace_, the unapologetic promiscuity of _Queer_ _as_ _Folk_.’

Russell T Davies, author of _Queer_ _as_ _Folk_ and _It’s a Sin_, has described _Tales_ _of_ _the_ _City_ as: ‘The first and best series to show gay life on the screen.’
