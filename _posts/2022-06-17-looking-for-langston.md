The influence of Isaac Julien’s groundbreaking, lyrical and poetic meditation on the life of revered Harlem Renaissance poet Langston Hughes still ripples throughout the representation of queerness on screen today. Following the film, host of the award-winning Busy Being Black podcast Josh Rivers will be joined by BFI Race Equality Lead Rico Johnson-Sinclair and Black Queer Media Writer Rico Norwood to discuss the work (alongside Marlon T Riggs’ _Tongues Untied_) and explore the past, present, and future of queer cinema, reaffirming modern queer cinema’s afro-centric roots.

In Isaac Julien’s film, Langston Hughes is not the subject of a biographical documentary so much as an evanescent presence invoked by a dream-like montage of poetry, music and cultural history. Hughes is widely remembered as the key poet of the Black American artistic movement in the 1920s known as the Harlem Renaissance, but here his public persona is secondary to the enigma of his private life – his sexuality. In an age when homosexuality was regarded as a ‘sin against the race’, the idea of ‘coming out’ was unthinkable. _Looking for Langston_ imaginatively reconstructs a world previously hidden from history and reflects on ‘the beauty of the people with freakish ways’.

Its languid monochrome texture and stylised art direction evoke an ambiguous sense of time and place. Characters inhabit the fictional milieu of a 20s speakeasy, in which tuxedoed couples dance and drink champagne, celebrating hedonistic pleasure in defiance of the hostile world outside, which intrudes at the end as thugs and police raid the club and 80s house music plays on the soundtrack, almost like a music video. Archival film and sound recordings combine with contemporary poetry and music by Essex Hemphill and Blackberri, both Black gay American artists. In its mosaic of visual and literary quotation – from James Baldwin and Toni Morrison to Jean Cocteau and Kenneth Anger – the film unravels complex themes of sexual repression and racial transgression. For example, an exchange of looks between Langston (Ben Ellison) and his mythic object of desire, ‘Beauty’ (Matthew Baidoo), provokes a hostile, competitive glare from Beauty’s white male partner (John Wilson), who in turn contemptuously rejects the inquiring look of a young Black man. Allusions to pornography and Robert Mapplethorpe’s Black nudes similarly underline the question of who has the ‘right to look’, without oversimplifying the erotic fascination with ‘difference’ that gives a volatile edge to interracial sexuality.

Like other young Black British independent filmmakers, Julien is motivated by a concern with the past in order to throw new light on contemporary issues.  
The contributions of Black artists to modernism have been consistently written out of official versions of history – or, as Stuart Hall conveys in the film’s commentary, after the 20s the ‘primitive’ Negro was no longer in vogue and wealthy white patrons found other uses for their money. In this sense, _Looking for Langston_ is an archaeological project, reconstructing the historical continuum in which Black aesthetic expression has been an integral part of modernism. And it points out that the contributions of Black women and gay men have been rendered even more invisible by conservative notions about a homogeneous and undifferentiated Black ‘community’.

This critical interest in history suggests that Julien is attempting a dialogue (or its visual equivalent) with the different traditions from which he has invented his own artistic identity as a Black gay ‘auteur’. Black people have historically been the objects of representation, rather than its subjects and creators, as racism often determines who gets access to the means of representation in the first place. Julien overturns this double-bind as the Black subject ‘looks back’. Certain motifs, such as the ‘direct look’ whereby Black characters seem to ask the audience what they are looking for, appeared in the first film by Julien and the Sankofa workshop, _Territories_ (1984). With a new degree of self-confidence (and a considerably larger budget), _Looking for Langston_ continues and develops this artistic project, deepening the critique of racial representation by extending it into the domain of fantasy. At times, the seductive quality of the film’s preoccupation with its own stylishness risks a degree of cliché, but this is a risk worth taking if a wider audience is thereby invited into the dialogue about the ‘politics of difference’.
