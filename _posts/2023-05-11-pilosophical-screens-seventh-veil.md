Our regular philosophical screens event series exploring cinema through a philosophical lens returns this month with a focus on _The Seventh Veil_. With her script, Muriel Box became the first woman to win the Academy Award™ for Best Original Screenplay.

Join our regular film philosophers Lucy Bolton and Catherine Wheatley, along with special guest Adam Plummer, to consider this classic melodrama.

**Lucy Bolton** is Reader in Film Studies at Queen Mary University of London. She is the author of _Contemporary Cinema and the Philosophy of Iris Murdoch_ (EUP, 2019) and is currently writing a book on philosophy and film stardom.

**Catherine Wheatley** is Reader in Film and Visual Culture at King’s College London. Her books include _Stanley Cavell and Film: Scepticism and Self-Reliance at the Cinema, Michael Haneke’s Cinema: The Ethic of the Image_, the BFI Film Classics book on _Caché_, and, with Lucy Mazdon, _Sex, Art and Cinephilia: French Cinema in Britain._ Catherine also writes regularly for _Sight and Sound_ magazine.

**Adam Plummer**  has taught film theory, film history and film philosophy at Queen Mary University of London, and is now an independent writer based in the UK. His book, _The British Trauma Film:_ _Psychoanalysis and Popular British Cinema in the Immediate Aftermath of the Second World War_ (which is to be released later this month) uses a critical theory framework to understand the role that psychoanalysis plays in British culture at this time as an historical discourse. He analyses six British films of the period: _The Halfway House_, _Dead of Night_, _The Seventh Veil_, _Madonna of the Seven Moons_, _They Made Me a Fugitive_, and _Mine Own Executioner_ and demonstrates how psychoanalysis operates within them as a narrative and formal structuring mechanism. He argues that this engagement enables these films to begin to address the emotional fallout of the war by creating safe representational spaces where contemporary audiences could engage with their own traumatic experiences.
