As part of our François Truffaut season we offer you an opportunity to see a landmark film about difference and social acceptance. Based on real events from 1798, informed by research,  
_L’ Enfant sauvage_ tells of a doctor’s project to educate a non-verbal boy found living alone in the forest.

Presented in partnership with the Film Department, Queen Mary University, London in collaboration with Autism through Cinema Podcast, supported by Wellcome.

The screening will be introduced and there will be a facilitated discussion afterwards.

This event will be led by Janet Harbord (Professor of Film, Queen Mary University of London) and Ethan Lyon (PhD student at University of Southampton researching Gothic Horror cinema and its relationship to autism), both members of the Autism through Cinema podcast.<br>
