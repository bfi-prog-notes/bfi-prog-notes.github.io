Few directors have been as committed to articulating film as a medium distinct from other forms of drama and storytelling as Peter Greenaway. Working as filmmaker and visual artist, Greenaway has engaged with and drawn on various art forms, asking questions about the role of art within culture.

**Speakers**

**William Fowler** is Curator of Artists’ Moving Image at the BFI National Archive where he acquires, restores and curates films. His projects have included Queer Pagan Punk: Derek Jarman, the biggest ever UK retrospective of Jarman’s films, and This Is Now: Film and Video After Punk which toured internationally in collaboration with artist moving image agency LUX. He is co-author of _The Bodies Beneath: The Flipside of British Film and Television_ published by Strange Attractor Press in 2019.

**Josephine Botting** is a Fiction Curator at the BFI National Archive and author of _Adrian Brunel and British Cinema of the 1920s_, to be published in 2023.

**Jeremy Clarke** has been writing about movies in various UK print publications since the late 1980s as well as online in recent years. He’s excited by movies which provoke audiences, upset convention and make people think. He doesn’t buy the idea of mere entertainment – at the very least, if a movie doesn’t challenge the viewer in some way, it may simply confirm audience prejudices and bolster the status quo. Which seems pointless. He wants to be pushed, taken into new ways of seeing.

His writing on movies can be found at his website Jeremy C. Processing. His work also currently appears in _Reform_ magazine and All the Anime and DMovies.org among others. Many of the magazines in which his work has appeared regularly are sadly now no longer with us, notably _Films and Filming_, _What’s on in London_, _Manga Max_ (formerly _Manga Mania_), _Home Entertainment_, _Starlog_ (UK edition), _Top_ (the Tower Records magazine) and _Third Way_ magazine.

He is a member of both FIPRESCI (the International Federation of Film Critics) and the London Critics Circle (Film Section), and serves on the committee for the latter’s annual Film Awards.

**Victor Fraga** is an Anglo-Brazilian journalist, filmmaker and exhibitor. Born in Brazil and based in London for 25 years, he is the founder and director of DMovies (aka Dirty Movies), the portal for thought-provoking cinema, one of the leading indie film publications in the UK since 2016. He has recently directed two films, _The Coup d’Etat Factory_ and _The Flour Test_, showcased in festivals and cinemas on both sides of the Atlantic. Victor believes that cinema is a powerful transformational tool on a personal, social and also political level. This vision is reflected on DMovies and his films. Victor is also a film exhibitor: he organises screenings and events across the British capital, also through DMovies. In 2020, Victor interviewed Peter Greenaway for three hours as part of a tribute for _Doesn’t Exist_ magazine.

**John Wilson ACE:** Cutting his teeth on documentaries, it was while working at the Central Office of Information that John met Peter Greenaway and began a long and fruitful collaboration which saw him editing many of Greenaway’s prolific output of music documentaries and arts programmes for television, as well as five feature films beginning with _The Draughtsman’s Contract_ (1982) and culminating in the highly acclaimed _The Cook, the Thief, His Wife & Her Lover_ (1989).

Now one of Britain’s leading film editors, John Wilson’s films include _Billy Elliot_ (2000), which gained 13 BAFTA and three Oscar nominations including a BAFTA and an ACE Eddie nomination for Best Film Editing. Following this US nomination, John was invited to join American Cinema Editors (ACE). Other films include _The History Boys_ (2006) _The Book Thief_ (2013) and _Me Before You_ (2016). He has also edited 13 episodes of _Downton Abbey_.

John’s most recent film _Allelujah_ premiered at this year’s London Film Festival
