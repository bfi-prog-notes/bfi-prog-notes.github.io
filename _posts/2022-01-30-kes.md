**What’s it about?**

Young Billy lives in a South Yorkshire mining community where he endures harsh treatment at home and at school. His life changes for the better, however, when he starts looking after a young kestrel and ultimately finds a skill that he’s interested in pursuing. _Kes_, both funny and bleak, is an uncompromising look at unlocking potential, and a true classic from one of the UK’s finest directors.<br>
