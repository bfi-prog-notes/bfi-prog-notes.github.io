In the twelve years since _The Nightmare before Christmas_, which was directed by Henry Selick but conceived by Tim Burton, stop-motion animation has become almost an endangered technique. The makers of new versions of _King Kong_ and _The Magic Roundabout_, properties associated with ‘traditional’ dimensional animation, used CGI to bring their creatures to life. But now Burton has returned to frame-by-frame puppet manipulation with _Corpse Bride_, co-directed by Mike Johnson. Perhaps because he began his career (with the 1983 short _Vincent_) as an animator in the tradition of Ray Harryhausen (who gets a name-check in this as a make of piano), Burton retains a powerful affection for the technique and deems CGI (which he has used often) as just a tool.

The new film showcases the subtle effects the technique can manage, with texture and detail, lighting and costuming still beyond anything computers can achieve, and a satisfying physicality entirely apt in a tale so intent on the flesh. Like _Edward Scissorhands_, this is one of Burton’s more personal projects. The story has roots in a Russian folk tale, but the character designs are Burton’s (in partnership with Carlos Grangel), and the film is unmistakably set in a world that is wholly his rather than, say, partly Bob Kane’s, Roald Dahl’s or Washington Irving’s.

Burton’s visual influences are often noted: the cartoons of Charles Addams, the illustrated books of Edward Gorey, the expressionist stylings of Universal horror films, the bebop animations of Max and Dave Fleischer. Echoes of all these recur here, along with signature touches like the perky skeleton dog Scraps, exhumed from his cigar-box coffin and reunited with his former owner Victor (if you doubt how complex stop-motion ‘acting’ can be, note Scraps’ expression when Victor thoughtlessly asks him to ‘play dead’), and the decaying waif, voiced by Helena Bonham Carter, who is literally falling apart with yearning for the self-absorbed leading man. It is perhaps indicative of Bonham Carter’s increasing presence in Burton’s personal and artistic lives that in this film the marginalised living doll of _Nightmare_ is promoted to active heroine as the eponymous corpse bride.

After the reassessment of parent-child relationships in the slightly syrupy _Big Fish_ (2004), we are back to a world of grown-ups who don’t understand, with nastily amusing caricatures of both the social-climbing Van Dorts (voiced by Tracey Ullman and Paul Whitehouse) and the decayed Mervyn Peake-style aristocratic Everglots (Albert Finney and Joanna Lumley). Burton’s love of horror-movie arcana surfaces in his casting of Christopher Lee and Michael Gough, antagonists in Hammer’s first _Dracula_, as parallel spiritual figures: respectively, the dry-as-dust, bullying pastor of the living world and the skeletal but humane elder of the dead.

As Burton has been saying since _Beetle Juice_ (1988), the dead have more fun – or at least afford more opportunities for inventive sight gags. This film boasts a skeletal soldier with a cannonball-shaped hole in his ribcage, a dead Napoleon clone called General Bonesapart with a kiss-curl painted on the front of his skull and a head waiter who is nothing more than a severed head carried around by scuttling beetles. The graveyard humour that was so appealing in _Nightmare_ returns in extremis: a hep-cat number is performed by a singing skeleton; the maggot that lives inside the heroine’s head (and often pops out of her eye sockets) poses briefly as a Jimmy Cricket-style conscience and then shows a face and voice modelled on the Warner Bros. cartoon version of Peter Lorre. But the film also works hard with its living characters. The hero’s demure fiancée Victoria, given vocal bite by Emily Watson, and the dastardly villain Barkis Bittern, purred smugly by Richard E. Grant, are figures from Wilkie Collins, lightly satirised but nicely rounded.

As with Pee-Wee Herman and Willy Wonka, Burton projects the image of someone too conscious of the not always admirably childish aspects of his nature to get on all that well with real children. _Nightmare_ did manage to become some sort of holiday classic, but _Corpse Bride_ might be a more fragile prospect. Could its title contain two more unappetising words for a young audience? Kids who chuckle at gruesome gags about decay might find the ‘bride’ bit most difficult to swallow. But it’s played with utmost sincerity. Like _Beetle Juice_, this has an interrupted wedding at its climax, with the dead freak not going through with entrapment of the living partner. Unusually, the Burton stand-in, voiced by Johnny Depp, represents normality, and the woman, albeit played by Mrs Burton, is the defiant and flamboyant outsider who must step aside to allow for a restoration of balance.
