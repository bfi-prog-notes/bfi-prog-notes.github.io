Released in the very middle of the 1960s, this John Schlesinger film also feels like the very epicentre of the scene. Julie Christie’s Diana Scott seems like the girl who has it all, but being the life of the party isn’t all it’s cracked up to be. Just as the sixties were about to hit full swing, this sharp satire reveals the paper-thin reality of cover-story perfection.  
**Edgar Wright**

Jaunty, heartless and stylistically nimble right from its knowing primary-school-to-poster-girl opening montage, John Schlesinger’s Swinging London picaresque has a shrugging confidence and stinging cynicism that have weathered well. The irony-filled gap between careerist model Diana Scott’s heartfelt narration and her ruthless bed-by-bed social ascent still packs a punch, even as the film’s cruder satirical attempts (a tantrums-and-tiaras charity auction, a cod-Fellini decadent parlour game) have lost theirs.

If _Darling_ lacks the warmth of _Billy Liar_ (1963) or the emotional heft of _Midnight Cowboy_ (1969), its strong suit is its gimlet eye, ever alert to the hypocrisies of the bedroom and Laurence Harvey’s career-making boardroom. Frederic Raphael’s spiky script dissects Diana’s modus operandi mercilessly: ‘Your idea of fidelity is not having more than one man in bed at the same time.’ Yet there’s a curious dissonance between Julie Christie’s restless Diana, the quintessence of 60s New Womanhood, and the film’s class-bound 50s view of London life. Where _Georgy Girl_ and _Alfie_ are exuberant about the new British youth culture, _Darling_ sidesteps it. But Christie’s thin-skinned Oscar-winning performance brings pathos to the film’s misogynistic morality tale, which extended even to the original knicker-pink poster: ‘Shame, shame, everybody knows your name!’

**A contemporary review**  
One day, someone is going to make a film about a model (or film star, or beauty queen) with a witty, daring and unconventional theme. The heroine will make a great deal of money; she will live playfully and extravagantly; she will marry even more money. The daring and unconventional aspect will be that she isn’t noticeably corrupted by all this. But not yet. To suggest that it could be anything but terrible at the top is apparently more than flesh and blood can stand; and the thing that surprises me about a film like _Darling_ is that people as thoroughly sophisticated as John Schlesinger and Frederic Raphael should accept the constrictions of so many flatly fashionable attitudes. _Darling_ is sometimes clever, often ugly, always self-conscious. But its view of the world belongs to the corridors of Wardour Street. Its disillusionment looks like that of a gossip columnist who has left the party with a monumental hangover, but will still be back next day to see how all the awful people are contriving to amuse themselves.

Apart from star-struck adolescents, who aren’t presumably the audience _Darling_ has in mind for itself, I believe people in general take a cooler and more sceptical view of show business and advertising than it suits those involved in these trades to imagine. The great glamour image is an advertising man’s four-colour illusion. To knock the props from under it, by showing the squalid, shabby, unhappy ‘reality’ (or, again, half-truth) below the surface, is, in 1965, an act of daring mainly to those within the charmed circle. And to be disenchanted, in any case, one must first have surrendered to an enchantment.

It goes without saying that a good deal of _Darling_ is clever, funny and spitefully accurate. The camera circles and jabs, and the shutter clicks on a freezing moment of self-disclosure. Surprisingly often, however, the filmmakers leave one in doubt about just what value they intend to attach to a scene. Perhaps some modern Savonarola might just pull it off, on his own terms. But that is not the Schlesinger-Raphael method: they are far too knowing, with their snatches of effete dialogue juxtaposed with images of greed and self-satisfaction.
