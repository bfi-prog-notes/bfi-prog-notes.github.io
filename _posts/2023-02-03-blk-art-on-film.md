Canvassing memory, inheritance and invasion, this programme of shorts is a melodic tribute to Indigenous strength and the poetic subversion of colonial amnesia. The artists address issues of state-sanctioned violence, child removals, stolen wages, land rights and the reclamation of language  
and archives.

There will be a brief interval before the screening of _TERROR NULLIUS_.

_TERROR NULLIUS_ from collective Soda Jerk.

**TERROR NULLIUS**Dir**:** Soda Jerk. Australia 2018. 54min

Sample art misfits Soda Jerk’s second feature is a blistering, badly behaved, sample-based film which confronts the horrors of Australia’s national mythologies. A political revenge fable that binds canonical interrogation with speculative muckraking, _TERROR NULLIUS_ premiered at ACMI in 2018.  
Five years later, its provocation is as dark, hopeful and urgent as ever.
