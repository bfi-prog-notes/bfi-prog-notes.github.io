**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

For reasons that are hard to fathom, _The People under the Stairs_ is one of  
Wes Craven’s less well remembered films, often overlooked amid all the adulation for the _A Nightmare on Elm Street_ and _Scream_ films. Which is a shame, as it’s one of Craven’s most overtly political films – like _The Last House on the Left_ (1972) and _The Hills Have Eyes_ (1977) it pits two disparate family groups against each other, in this case a wealthy and venal white couple against a poor and victimised working class black family.

Young black Los Angelino Fool (Brandon Adams) and his family are facing eviction from their white landlords the Robesons (Everett McGill and Wendy Robie). Fool accompanies Leroy (Ving Rhames) and Spencer (Jeremy Roberts) on a mission to break into the Robesons’ house, believing that they’re hoarding a stash of gold coins. But the robbery goes awry when Spencer is killed and Fool stumbles across a large group of feral, pale-faced cannibal children locked up in the basement. Fool also meets Alice (A.J. Langer), supposedly the Robesons’ daughter; though as he learns later, she and the other children in the basement were all abducted by the Robesons. Along with Roach (Sean Whalen) who has had his tongue cut out by the Robesons, they try to stay one step ahead of both the insane couple and their flesh-eating brood.

Craven took inspiration, in part, from the true story of a pair of burglars who broke into a Los Angeles house and inadvertently alerted the police to a pair of siblings who had been locked away in the cellar by their parents. Craven transforms an already shocking story into a witty and often very shocking film that has something interesting and important to say but never loses sight of its basic requirement – to scare its audience. And on that score, there’s no doubting its efficacy, containing as it does some of Craven’s most impressive jolts.

It’s a dark fairy story, with a princess that needs rescuing, a valiant young prince, wicked step-parents, a legendary stash of gold and an old dark house where the physical laws of the universe no longer seem to apply (Craven has referred to the house – which, as in the Tom and Jerry cartoons, seems to expand infinitely as the story demands it – as ‘the whole society of the United States’. It’s _Hansel and Gretel_ given a Gothic twist and transplanted to the ghettos of Los Angeles, then shot through with a streak of contemporary social politics – at the end, the victimised masses unite, rise up, overthrow their oppressors and literally tear down their capitalist edifice and redistribute  
their wealth.

Craven’s usual wit shines through, and amid the horror it’s often very funny. Indeed, the film’s masterstroke is in tackling weighty subjects – racism, inequality, greed – without ever taking itself terribly seriously. Its tongue is never far from its cheek, though it doesn’t skimp on the horror. There are plenty of creepy moments, macabre detours and effective scares, even if it’s not as grisly as perhaps it could have been.

The casting is perfect. Brandon Adams, A.J. Langer and Sean Whalen make for a likeable trio, with none of the precociousness that too often afflicts young performers. Ving Rhames comes and goes before he gets a chance to make that much of an impact so the adult acting end is held up by Everett McGill and Wendy Robie, reunited from _Twin Peaks_, where they played another married couple, ‘Big’ Ed and Nadine Hurley. Robie has a nice line in uncontrolled hysteria while McGill rampaging around the house in full leather fetish gear brandishing a shotgun is quite the sight to behold. The mutant brood in the cellar are realised by the effects make-up of KNB’s Gregory Nicotero, Robert Kurtzman and Howard Berger – if they don’t always exactly convince, they’re a lot of fun, a ghastly little family that finds themselves caught between the impromptu family formed by Fool, Alice and Roach and the repulsive Robesons.

_The People under the Stairs_ is a constantly surprising and inventive film, intelligent, funny and when it needs to be, quite scary. As a satire, it’s focused and potent (the film’s sharpest barbs are reserved for Reagan-era capitalism), the story twists and turns admirably and when the going gets nasty in the basement it’s satisfyingly unpleasant. It was released between the ho-hum _Shocker_ (1989) and _Wes Craven’s New Nightmare_ (1992) – the first flowering of the post-modern strain of horror that Craven would farm so effectively in the next few years. It’s definitely one of Craven’s high points and a film that has held up notably well – it was a hit at the box office in 1991 and it’s having fallen under the shadow of the director’s better-known films is a pity as it still has much to offer.

Craven had plans to remake the film and later announced a television series spin-off but neither ever got any further than the planning stages. In late 2020, Jordan Peele (director of _Get Out_ (2017), _Us_ (2019) and _Nope_ (2022)) and  
Win Rosenfeld (producer of _BlacKkKlansman_ (2018) and the _Candyman_ (2021) remake) signed up for a remake.
