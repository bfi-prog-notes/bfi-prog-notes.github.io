_+ Q&A with author Stephen Bourne_

Join us for a double-bill of short films made by Edric Connor, who was a popular Trinidadian singer, folklorist and actor. _Carnival Fantastique_ (UK, 1960) is a vibrant portrait of Trinidad’s world-famous carnival, and _Bound for Lagos_ (UK, 1960) is a romantic drama about shifting social relations.

The screenings will include an introduction and will be followed by a Q&A with Stephen Bourne, author of _Deep Are the Roots: Trailblazers Who Changed Black British Theatre_.  

**Bound for Lagos**
Commissioned in 1960 to mark Nigeria’s independence, Edric Connor directs and stars in this troubled production about shifting social relations in an emergent West African middle-class.

Pioneering West Indian filmmaker Edric Connor tours the Caribbean and Nigeria on the cusp of independence in these beautiful short films.

In 1959 he returned to the Caribbean, producing seven films in quick succession. A proud West Indian nationalist, Connor documents nation-building, focusing on flourishing commerce, reverently capturing the people and terrain.

**Carnival Fantastique**  
Held over the two days before Ash Wednesday, Trinidad’s famous carnival is the most anticipated event of the island’s cultural calendar. Here Edric Connor shows us the sights, sounds and styles of this glorious event.

Filmmaker Edric Connor was a Trinidadian actor and singer who popularised ‘Day Dah Light’, the song that became an international hit for Harry Belafonte as ‘Day-O’ (The Banana Boat Song). An actor in British and American films of the 1950s, Connor went on, with his wife Pearl, to set up the first theatrical agency for black British performers, the Afro-Asian-Caribbean Agency.
