**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away the film’s ending.

_Tokyo Twilight_ (1957) is still one of Ozu’s most moving films, and perhaps the blackest and most desolate in tone. It concerns a family thrice ruptured: a mother (Isuzu Yamada) long separated from the father (Ryu); one daughter, Takako (Setsuko Hara), leaving her husband and moving back in with her father; the other daughter, Akiko (lneko Arima), committing suicide after an abortion and a stormy reunion with her mother. _Tokyo Twilight_ is decidedly pessimistic, where _Early Summer_, say, is optimistic. But the pessimism is understated, distilled in sounds and silences. The dialogue is for the most part functional. (There _is_ one memorable line: after her elder daughter pays her a visit expressly to accuse her of causing the younger’s death, the mother changes her mind in favour of moving north: ‘I don’t like Tokyo any more.’) Generally, Ozu and Noda use dialogue to angle in on meaning, but in _Tokyo Twilight_ dialogue is often at best counterpoint to the centre of a scene – the face of a person waiting for someone, or mechanically continuing an action (brushing hair, operating a pinball machine) as he or she absorbs a disquieting idea or piece of news (Akiko suspecting that she has seen her long-lost mother; the father informed that she has gone to a neighbour for a loan). The words in such scenes are unimportant – the scene is in the empty, compulsive action or in the face, the signs of internal turmoil.

In _Tokyo Twilight_ the film is, simply, in the face of Akiko, whether she is looking for her boyfriend, Kenji, or waiting for him, or crying after she asks him what to do about the baby ­– her sobbing blending with the sounds of boat engines and muffled hammering from the harbour around her as she sits, almost motionless. The sounds and the image suggest finality, questions without answers. Akiko’s set, unsmiling face dominates the film, cutting knife-like through its fabric. Ozu respects the character’s dissatisfaction. He doesn’t attempt to placate her. By juxtaposing her sobbing with the muted thudding of engines, he likens the end of her subjective world to the dull continuation of the objective world. By giving these disparate sounds equal weight, he gives her anger and despair their proper authority as objective fact.

_Tokyo Twilight_ is unusually, unnaturally quiet for an Ozu film. The bland, functional dialogue, the silences, the cheerless black and white photography and the subdued, ironically lilting background music at once set off and mute the mood of despair. The meaning of the film rests in the pointed silences of the characters. Those silences are like psychic dead ends, intimations of defeat: the father at the pinball machine; Akiko refusing to answer his questions; Takako refusing to talk to her mother when she brings flowers for the dead Akiko; the boy stunned and silent after Akiko slaps him and runs out; the mother waiting in the train compartment for Takako (who purposefully does _not_ come to the station to say goodbye) as a military chorus sings in the background. (The latter an almost excruciatingly powerful scene of slowly extinguished hope, of irreconcilability.) These are the crucial, illuminative moments, revealing each character as essentially alone, helpless with his or her own feelings, like streams running down into nothing rather than out into the sea.

The chill melancholy of the film anticipates the air of anomie of characteristic late 50s/early 60s European films like _La Dolce Vita_, _The Fire Within_ and _Eclipse_ (and also recalls the chilliness of Val Lewton’s study of a suicide, _The Seventh Victim_, 1943). All Ozu’s films to some extent concern the effects of isolation and the dissolution of the family. But _Tokyo Twilight_ is only about such isolation and alienation, and is not necessarily a lesser film than, say, _Tokyo Story_ for its delimiting of subject. The muted sounds of a clock ticking, a train whistle or a dog barking late at night serve to underline the human silences at the heart of the film. The one sound that is not muted, that is perhaps even augmented, is that of a baby’s rattle, which its mother, Takako, accidentally kicks once and which Takako’s father picks up and shakes at the end of the film. That sound is the closest _Tokyo Twilight_ comes to a note of hope. Yet in the context of shattered lives and seemingly unaccountable breakdowns in relationships, the too harsh sound of the rattle becomes itself – if not quite pessimistic – ambiguous. The end of the film leaves the viewer with an overwhelming sense of helplessness, a helplessness that comes from seeing these two people left alone after the tragedy of the daughter’s suicide, with the tragedy of her suicide. As in _Late Spring_, we have been living with the daughter’s anguish and forgetting that of the father (and sister); and at the end we are still on the outside looking in, at these strangely ambiguous people we now realise we hardly know, and will never know. For the film ends with the father on his way to work, ‘like any other day’.
