**What’s it about?**

It’s the mid-17th century and young Robyn arrives in Ireland with her father, who is tasked with hunting down the local wolves.  Yet everything changes when Robyn befriends Mebh, a wolfwalker who has the ability to transform into wolf form when she sleeps.  This original and compelling tale sparkles with rich visuals and explores friendship, difference and acceptance.

**WolfWalkers: Old Ireland’s Hunters and Hunted**

_WolfWalkers_ follows the Irish director Tomm Moore’s hand-drawn cartoon films _The Secret of Kells_ (2009) and _Song of the Sea_ (2014). Each has children drawn into natural wonderlands of myth and magic, into adventures about protecting and healing rather than fighting.

_WolfWalkers_, which Moore co-directed with Ross Stewart, is set in 1650, during Ireland’s occupation by Oliver Cromwell, or a fictional equivalent – the character is called Lord Protector in the film, a title Cromwell only took in 1653. But what happens in _WolfWalkers_ hardly follows history. More important, the Lord Protector is the film’s clear and cruel villain – Moore has previously eschewed such characters.

The heroes of _WolfWalkers_ are two girls. Robyn Goodfellowe, despite her name’s folkloric connotations, is initially an ordinary girl from England. She’s come to Ireland with her father, voiced by Sean Bean, who hunts down wolves in the woods. Soon enough, Robyn encounters the wild girl Mebh, who lives in a magically hidden cavern behind a waterfall with the wolves she commands, frantically seeking her missing mother. Mebh can project her mind into a wolf’s body, leaping and dashing through trees and over rooftops, a power she inadvertently gives Robyn. The girls become fast friends, though Robyn’s devotion to her father places her in painful dilemmas.

Like the adult animation of Bill Plympton or the teen-skewed anime of Shinkai Makoto, Moore’s visual style is instantly identifiable. His films’ drawings can look naive and artless, but they’re wondrously composed with swirls and circles and glorious colours, flattened spaces and playful perspectives. Mebh’s wolf pack operates as a furry mass; its Hydra heads snarl scarily or grin goofily. Mebh herself is drawn as if half of her is her fiery swirling hair.

_WolfWalkers_ is more of an action-adventure than Moore’s other films, especially in its breathless extended climax. Some set pieces feel inspired by Miyazaki Hayao’s _Princess Mononoke_ (1997).

WolfWalkers is hugely successful in engaging us with the enchantingly expressive girls, and with Robyn’s love for her father.<br>
