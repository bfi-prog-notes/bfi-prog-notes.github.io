Artist Julian Schnabel’s directorial debut is a star-studded biopic of  
Jean-Michel Basquiat, a gifted and prolific painter and street artist who died at the age of 27 after an exceptional rise through the New York art scene in the 1980s. Bowie plays Andy Warhol, whom he was fascinated with and dedicated a song to him on his fourth album _Hunky Dory_. Other cast members include Gary Oldman, Christopher Walken, Courtney Love, Dennis Hopper and Willem Dafoe.

This first feature film by painter Julian Schnabel is as much an evocative thesis on creativity as a sensitive biography of a single artist. At times _Basquiat_ evokes Schnabel’s own imagination more than Jean-Michel Basquiat’s.  
There is, for example, only a loose factual account offered of Basquiat’s artistic development – his progression from his ‘Samo’ spray-painting graffiti phase to more complex paintings and art objects. Biography is not strictly this film’s primary concern: it wants to transcend the narrow confines of realism exemplified by Vincente Minnelli’s Van Gogh biopic _Lust for Life_.

For all its anomalies, _Basquiat_ nonetheless feels majestic and confident. Basquiat’s irreverent charisma, his emotional dependency and his wilful self-destructiveness are sensitively expressed through Jeffrey Wright’s performance. Particularly distinctive is the repertoire of poses and movements Wright evolves to capture Basquiat’s aloof coquettishness – his floaty, camp shuffling as he walks through New York streets, or his slow, intricate hand gestures. Through Wright’s performance Schnabel also offers here a eulogy to the physicality of Basquiat’s brash artistic talent. We see him obsessively spraying hip-hop _haikus_ on dilapidated walls or (with a cursory nod towards Scorsese’s ‘Life Lessons’ segment of _New York Stories_) executing his first sprawling painting after being given a studio space by Nosei, splashing vibrant colour onto an unwieldy, loose canvas on the floor to the accompaniment of music by Tom Waits, Charlie Parker and Dizzy Gillespie.

This is a bold, often beautiful film, and when the focus is on Basquiat’s visual imagination, Schnabel absents his _auteurist_ self and serves his subject far better. The image one comes away with is of Basquiat towards the end of his life. Already spiralling out of control, he stands astride Benny’s jeep, triumphantly waving and grinning, dressed in pyjamas and clogs inscribed with the word ‘Titanic’. _Basquiat_ works best when, as here, Schnabel celebrates his protagonist’s infectious, childish, alienated vibrancy.
