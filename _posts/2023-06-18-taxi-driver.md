**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

New York in the 1970s as seen through the rabid eyes of disillusioned Vietnam veteran Travis Bickle (De Niro), working nights as a taxi-driver and increasingly determined to clear the streets of the moral turpitude he believes is overtaking the city. Scorsese’s film is a deeply unsettling foray into a poisoned mind, reflected both in Michael Chapman’s infernal imagery and in Bernard Herrmann’s expressive score.
