After the great public and critical success of _The Six Wives of Henry VIII_ (1970), the BBC turned hopefully to the turbulent life of the King’s daughter, Elizabeth.  The approach was essentially the same – six 90-minute plays covering the life of the monarch from youth to old age – and proved to be even more popular.

A sense of continuity was ensured with several actors reprising their roles, including Rosalie Crutchley and John Ronane as Catherine Parr and Thomas Seymour and Bernard Hepton and Basil Dignam as the Archbishops Cranmer and Gardiner respectively, while writers John Prebble and Rosemary Anne Sissons also returned. As before, the success of the project would rest mainly on the shoulders of the central actor, and for Glenda Jackson it proved to be the role of a lifetime, eclipsing even her Oscar-winning performances in _Women in Love_ (1969) and _A Touch of Class_ (1973). She maintains a steely authority and powerful sense of femininity throughout, even in the conclusion, when her face is grotesquely covered in thick white make-up.

John Hale’s opening play, ‘The Lion’s Cub’, makes few concessions to viewers not steeped in late-Tudor history, hurtling through a decade of complex events taking in the execution of Thomas Seymour, Elizabeth’s guardian, for attempting to topple the sickly King Edward VI, and the crowning of Mary I, before concluding with Elizabeth’s coronation in 1558. Internecine plots predominate at court and make for engrossing, if occasionally bewildering viewing, whether dealing with foreign affairs, religious conflicts or Elizabeth’s marriage. The ‘behind the scenes’ approach is fascinatingly explored in Prebble’s ‘The Enterprise of England’, depicting the war with Spain solely through Elizabeth and Philip II’s thrust and parry with their respective advisors, omitting battle scenes altogether.

As befits a major BBC historical drama, the requisite splendours of costume and design are emphasised, but originality is also evident: filming the flashbacks to Elizabeth’s youth with a subjective camera; building studio sets with ornate ceilings; and the challenging use of dark humour underlining Julian Mitchell’s moving depiction of the Queen’s marriage problems in ‘Shadow in the Sun’.

There was no feature film version as there was for _Henry VIII_, although Jackson  did play Elizabeth again in _Mary, Queen of Scots_ (1972), written by _Elizabeth R_  co-author John Hale.
