It’s 2071 and Earth has been abandoned for settlements on different moons and planets in the solar system. The spaceship Bepop is home to a group of bounty hunters who are seeking a terrorist threatening to wipe out the population on Mars using a deadly pathogen. This feature version of the successful anime TV series uses live-action camera angles to elevate the animation, and features a cracking score by Yoko Kanno (performed by her band Seatbelts).

Created as a side-story from a Japanese television cartoon of the same name (screened in the UK on the digital channel CNX), _Cowboy Bebop_ remains accessible to newcomers: though set in a future replete with sci-fi hardware, it’s essentially a hard-boiled detective thriller in animated form. The rather meandering mystery is punctuated with satisfyingly meaty fights and a sprinkling of existential angst, the whole held together by the lanky central figure of Spike, a ‘cowboy’ bounty hunter whose narcoleptic languor and stork-like gait give way to lightning speed and savagery in the main set pieces. Spike brings to mind any number of American gumshoes, but the character also recalls the adventurer-cum-thief Lupin III, a hero of Japanese comics and cartoons, himself partly based on James Bond.

The film’s city, Alva (ostensibly on Mars though much of the movie could be set on present-day Earth), is similarly transnational with a Manhattan-style skyline sporting prominent Twin Towers, a fight on a Tokyo Tower clone and a thriving Moroccan district brimming with African exoticism, all slatted shadows and yellow light. The setting is rendered with a polished hyperrealism which, combined with the non-cartoony animation (only the loose-limbed girl Edward approaches caricature), prompts the question why the film wasn’t produced in live action; the answer seems to be to heighten the larger-than-life melodrama of the story. While there’s awkward movement in many scenes, the main fights are well composed, conveying a keen sense of dramatic confrontation. The tower battle is lit by fireworks and floating lanterns, while an earlier fight takes place on an elevated train racing high over the city bay.

There’s also the suggestion of a link between the film’s cartoon form and its thematic content. A minor baddie, introduced playing a videogame from the 1980s, is a techno-nerd who can’t tell life from virtuality. Later we discover that the main adversary, the solipsistic, solitaire-playing Vincent, thinks existence is a dream after his mind has been scrambled. The victims of a mysterious virus see glowing butterflies that swarm over the final fight ­­– both an analogue to the doves that counterpoint live-action violence in John Woo’s films and a nod to Chuang Tzu’s aphorism about a man and a butterfly uncertain which one is dreaming the existence of the other.

Vincent is redeemed by recognising the girl he once loved and it’s suggested the same might be true of Spike, who insists he’s ‘just a bounty hunter’ exempt from responsibility, but is still prompted to reminisce about the girl who gave him life and the fear of death. If this sounds corny on page, it feels less so in the mouth of an iconic _anime_ character.

The pace is diluted by extraneous scenes featuring the supporting cast, presumably to satisfy fans of the original series. The film also follows the tendency of other Japanese cartoons by creating redundant action scenes with impersonal sci-fi vehicles, often as tedious as the CG monsters in live-action pictures. Despite this, _Cowboy Bebop_ succeeds as a stylish, enjoyable blend of genres and formats. (The director Shinichiro Watanabe also worked on the high-quality Japanese animations _Escaflowne_ and Macross Plus, both available in the UK on DVD.) It also offers the opportunity to hear music by Yoko Kanno, the most celebrated composer in Japanese animation, though her work here lacks the polymath eclecticism of her best scores. Like the film itself, it’s polished rather than ground breaking, and there’s none of the jazz bebop of the title.
