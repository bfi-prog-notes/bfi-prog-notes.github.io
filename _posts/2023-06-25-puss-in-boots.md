**Puss in Boots:  The Last Wish**

**What’s it about?**  
Puss in Boots is back. His nine lives are fast running out and his ex, Kitty Softpaws is back in his life as they both search for a map that has the location of the wishing star on it. This hilarious, Oscar nominated follow up to 2011’s original film has been widely praised for its animation style which is inspired by storybook illustrations and its edgy script that sees Puss coming to terms with his own limitations.  

**BFI Film Academy Recommends**  
BFI Film Academy Recommends highlights films and events for young people aged  
16-25, picked by the BFI Film Academy Young Programmers.

A joyous cinematic experience for audiences of all ages, _Puss in Boots: The Last Wish_ combines whimsically detailed animation with a musically driven narrative, packed with lots of laughs, love and heart!

The voice cast do a stellar job in bringing the film to life, and the humour lands terrifically. But most of all, the film hits home a daring message about mortality and the value of life.

It’s no surprise that this cute spin-off from the _Shrek_ franchise has been a hit with the Oscars, perfect for a family audience but striking an emotional chord with young viewers too!
