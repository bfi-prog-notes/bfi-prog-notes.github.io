Originally produced for television, Ingmar Bergman’s rendering of Mozart’s beloved opera is a cinematic spectacle. The film blurs the boundaries of theatre, between audience and stage, as Tamino ventures with his fantastical instrument to rescue Pamina and vanquish the Queen of the Night. Join us after the screening to reflect on the nature of performativity, escapism, and neurodivergence.

The screening and discussion are hosted by film critic and writer Lillian Crawford.
