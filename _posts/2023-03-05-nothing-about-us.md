A disabled-led discourse on accessible advancements within the film industry.

‘Nothing About Us Without Us’ will be a celebration of the BFI’s Disability Screen Advisory Group’s first cohort of leaders: Andrew Miller MBE, David Proud and Kim Tserkezie, joining us virtually, who will shortly step down after 5 years in post driving inclusive change in film.
