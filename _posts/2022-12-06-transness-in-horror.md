**Panellists: Sarah Cleary, Fey Kapur, Sam Moore, and Alison Rumfitt will be in conversation, with Jaye Hudson hosting.**

Many of the twentieth-century’s most notable depictions of gender-nonconforming and trans-coded characters appear in horror movies, as pathologised figures intended to terrify and bewilder a presumedly cisgender audience. These portrayals have often done real harm to actually-existing trans people, fuelling the overwrought cultural anxieties surrounding the possibility of gender transition. Yet horror as a genre has often been beloved by trans makers and audiences: both for the subversive freedom with which it has always approached taboo topics, and for the genre’s radical approaches to matters of transformation, trauma and survival. With more complicated and considered portrayals dating back at least as far as exploitation pioneer Ed Wood’s 1953 debut _Glen or Glenda_, alongside a range of recent works celebrated work by trans creatives that explicitly contend with the relationship between transness and horror, the unique possibility of the genre for depicting and responding to societal anxieties around gender is being taken up more readily than ever. Join us for this discussion, with clips, exploring the pitfalls and potentials of the genre.
