**Ray on ‘The Adventures of Goopy and Bagha’**

_In your fairytale_ The Adventures of Goopy and Bagha _, did American musicals provide you with any models?_

No, I don’t think so. _Goopy Gyne_ was completely original. I had no models in mind at all, so far as I can recall, certainly not American musicals. The film grew from the story – which was adapted from an original story by my grandfather – and the songs grew from the situations…

In the _Goopy Gyne_ script-books, first I drew the outline of the plot as it would be developed for the screen, and along with that, on the left-hand side of the page, were written the words for the songs; I was scribbling ideas. And so the songs came once I’d got the story structure in my mind. When the situations presented themselves, I stopped writing the story and began working on the songs. In most cases they were more or less retained as they came.

_So the music of the songs was not drawn from any Indian styles?_

It does draw on Indian folk songs and classical songs, and there are even Western touches – the orchestration is certainly very Western.

And there are parodies of certain singing styles. One song comes straight from South India. The accompaniment is South Indian; I used a vina [Indian stringed instrument] and percussion as played in the South Indian manner. It’s the song where Goopy and Bagha are really caught, but Goopy suddenly bursts into song and that’s how they escape. They do the neck movement while running away – that’s also a South Indian dance thing.

But overall, in _Goopy Gyne_ and its sequel _The Kingdom of Diamonds_ [_Hirak Rajar Deshe_, 1980], the songs are my songs if you come to think about it. I have definitely set a style of singing which doesn’t come from Rabindranath Tagore, doesn’t come from Western music, but which is essentially me.

**A contemporary review**  
Based on a Bengali fairy-tale written by his grandfather, _The Adventures of Goopy and Bagha_ is a picturesque departure from Ray’s traditional style of work. The film is rather ominously subtitled ‘A Fairy-tale for Adults’, and for children one suspects it will have its longueurs, especially in the later part where picaresque narrative gives way to overt _Gulliver’s Travels_-type satire on the inanities of war. But the first part of the film not only affirms Ray’s instinctive story-telling ability (with a satisfying use of the wipe to cut the narrative into chapters), but reveals an unexpected flair for surrealist detail. The King of the Ghosts materialises modernistically in front of a giant triangle of flashing neon lights, and addresses the heroes in the harsh electronic tones of a science-fiction creature. Both here and in the ensuing sequences where Goopy and Bagha discover the possibilities of their three wishes (a banquet miraculously appearing in the desert, Goopy bursting into lyrical song as he walks by the river at dawn), the film captures the irresistible mixture of comedy and surprise that belongs to the best fairy stories.

While laughing at Goopy and Bagha as a comic duo – one tall, the other short; one benign and simple, the other quick-witted and startled-looking – we still share their amazed responses to the happenings around them. Indeed, interest lapses precisely when Goopy and Bagha fade into the background during the Halla section and leave the stage to a trio of stock pantomime figures – demented wizard, evil prime minister, manipulated king – whom all Ray’s inventive details of mannerism and costume (the wizard’s speeded-up walk, the long swaying antennae on his magic hat) cannot quite bring to life.

In a film so obtrusively divided down the middle, the one harmonising factor is the role of music. Goopy and Bagha’s songs are not merely musical interludes, but mark the four pivotal stages in the development of the story – Goopy’s banishment, the appearance of the King of the Ghosts, the boys’ acceptance at court, the prevention of the war. Exquisitely sung and staged, the songs are a persuasive metaphor for harmony in a divided world, and the kingdom of Shundi clearly owes its peaceful nature to the fact that its subjects cannot talk but can only make music. Perhaps we shouldn’t be too pleased when, at the end of the film, the joy of victory restores their power of speech.
