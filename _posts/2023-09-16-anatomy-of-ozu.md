An afternoon of illustrated talks and discussions exploring some of the elements that make the world of Ozu’s films so rich and distinctive, including his meticulous style, recurring use of domestic spaces, and a sharp eye on the family structures in post-war Japanese society. Our invited speakers will also discuss his key collaborators, consider the use of humour in his work as well as look at the immense impact his oeuvre has had on generations of filmmakers.
