**Aimee Victoria** was written and produced by Mikail as part of a short form series created entirely remotely. Natasha was cast, gave a wonderful performance and they got on brilliantly so had been talking about making something together afterwards.

_Aimee Victoria_ is a deaf queer love story created entirely remotely. No members of the cast or crew met in person and it was made during the height of lockdown in 2020. It is one of the first films to feature a relationship between two deaf women and is an uplifting story of love and commitment.  
We are currently developing this as a feature film.  

**The Multi** was written, produced by and stars Natasha – she wrote the script and kindly asked Mikail if he would come onboard.

_The Multi_ tackles the impact of lifelong trauma and mental health, especially from the perspective of the black deaf female community. It was created semi-remotely with a majority deaf cast and crew. Filmed in between LA County lockdowns, the numbers of crew were limited to ensure Covid compliance and key positions including American Sign Language interpreters joined the set through video conferencing. It has already been selected for a number of film festivals (including a Canadian Screen Awards Qualifier).
