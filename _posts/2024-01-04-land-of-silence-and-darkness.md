In an article devoted to _Land of Silence and Darkness_ in the _Quarterly Review of Film Studies_ (Spring 1980), William F. Van Wert puts the case for Herzog the documentarist versus the fantasist. ‘The film is no less stylised than other Herzog films, but here more than in any of his other films, his style derives from his subject, and the result is a breakthrough: the supposedly abnormal becomes normal, disability flip-flops and is transformed into ability, and the whole film is a head-and-heart experience, a sharing rather than a looking-at… No exotic tricks, no magic or forced mesmerism, no kinky hallucinations or traumas that lead inevitably to madness or suicide, as in his fiction films.’  
The formulation is a tempting one, both because it suggests in general that Herzog’s fascination with the extreme and the deviant poses communication problems that are solvable in the ‘real’ world, and because _Land of Silence  
and Darkness_ in particular does have a positive drift that is unique in Herzog’s work.

Reversing the plunge of most of his protagonists, he traces Fini Straubinger’s journey from her interior world to an exterior one, from poetic descriptions of the state of being deaf-blind to her actual travelling about Bavaria on behalf of those to whom she feels akin ‘in destiny’. The reversal begins with statements from Fini which qualify Herzog’s own title: ‘People think deafness means silence, but that’s wrong… It isn’t total darkness – you often see all kinds of colours’. As she then moves from case to case, from those with a greater disability (children who have been deaf-blind from birth) to those who have not been able to overcome their handicap (older people in homes, without family or whom no one has ‘tried to awaken’), she combines ministering angel with brisk social worker. ‘Poor dear, no contact with the world’, she comments of one old woman who has withdrawn totally into herself, chides another individual to hold himself straighter, and declares of the most extremely retarded case, 22-year-old Vladimir Kokol, ‘We can still get something out of him’. Pragmatic nursing also combines with political effort as she attends congresses and listens to speeches: ‘A society which doesn’t respect old people as a part of itself is condemning itself.’

So far, so helpful – but Herzog is less interested in education than in perception, less in mobilising society than in charting the vagaries of human experience. Which leads straight to the contradiction, or several contradictions, of _Land of Silence and Darkness_. That it is a ‘land’ to begin with is revealing: a special place whose inhabitants remain inaccessible except through a guide like Fini – who is both of their world and ours – or through the various technologies which teach them to simulate our language. Herzog seems to regard the latter as he does the medical enterprise of _Flying Doctors_, with a perfectly neutral scientific progressivism. But what they mainly reveal is what we can never know: the instructor of two deaf-blind boys comments on the difficulty of imparting abstract ideas, and during a session in which they are taught speech by a mechanical vibration method, the commentator (a pseudonymous Herzog?) observes, ‘What they understand as “proud”, “happy”, etc., will always be a mystery to us.’ Beyond this, the socialising of these exotic creatures contains an implicit irony which _The Enigma of Kaspar Hauser_ will take up as an explicit attack on bourgeois society. The  land of silence and darkness is a state of nature, and it is in Nature that the people here seem most fulfilled (playing with animals at the zoo, similarly caressing and testing out plants) rather than in their partial adaptation to normal human society. Vladimir Kokol, the most extremely disadvantaged, has been adapted to the most incongruous extreme: neatly dressed in jumper and tie, he sits on the floor blowing raspberries and striking himself with a ball, while a clock discreetly chimes off. Walking into a garden with her last case, Heinrich Fleischmann, Fini sits talking with two other women while a hand-held camera delightedly follows Heinrich, who wanders off to hug one of the trees. He is eventually led back indoors, but the camera remains in the garden, watching the dwindling figures.

Herzog does not suggest that his subjects would be better left to their own devices than being socialised to some degree. But human society and its agents are so quickly diminished in his transcendental view of things that it is not hard to see the blandness of the balance here moving towards the spiritual bleakness of _Kaspar Hauser_. Herzog’s account of Fini Straubinger’s career is not really a movement from the subjective to the objective, but a merging of her subjectivity with his in a kind of detached meditation, blind vision meeting visionary blindness. (The play of ironies between seeing and not seeing culminates in the episode where Fini is taken up for the first time in an aeroplane, a favourite Herzog image for the sublimity and terror of life.) Likewise, the titles that break up the film suggest comments of Fini’s ‘objectified’ by Herzog: ‘When you let go of my hand, it is as if we were a thousand miles apart’; ‘If a world-wide war would break out now, I wouldn’t even notice it.’ One of her few sighted memories, anticipating _Woodcarver Steiner_, is of a ski-jumper. The fascination of _Land of Silence and Darkness_ is not that it ‘grounds’ Herzog’s later fictions but that it leads directly to them, from fantasised documentaries to documented fantasies.
