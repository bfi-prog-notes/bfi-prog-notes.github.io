**SPOILER WARNING  The following notes give away the film’s ending.**

The ugly duckling of Orson Welles’ wayward career, _The Stranger_ was the director’s attempt to prove to increasingly sceptical paymasters that he could tackle something conventional if he really put his mind to it (though he then made _The Lady from Shanghai_, and burned his Hollywood bridges almost for good). Although minor Welles almost by definition, it’s nonetheless a very watchable thriller about wanted Holocaust architect Franz Kindler (Welles) pursued by a proto-Simon Wiesenthal (Edward G. Robinson) in small-town America.

Welles handles the suspense mechanics with appropriate brio, the clocktower climax being especially effective, but he also scores points for neither caricaturing the subject of Nazism (the film was shot and released while the main Nuremberg trials were still in session), nor making its Nazi an obvious Peter Lorre-style grotesque. Indeed, Welles’ performance is worryingly charismatic, though he lays his cards firmly on the table when he accidentally outs himself as an antisemite during a postprandial chat.

**A contemporary review**  
_The Stranger_, to which the critics looked forward because Orson Welles once directed two remarkable films, is no successor to those earlier achievements, though it contains many technical points of presentation which remind one of them. _The Stranger_ is good, but not excellent, thriller entertainment, in the same class as _Journey into Fear_. Welles himself plays magnificently a German war criminal who has escaped incognito to an American small town where he has become a college teacher. A minor war criminal is loosed to act as a decoy by Edward G. Robinson, who plays an investigator concerned to find the whereabouts of the major offender. The earlier scenes are beautifully done: the small-town setting is alive and vivid, and the character of the shop-keeper who works a ‘self-serve’ store is himself the best piece of cinema in the film.

_The Stranger_ is full of fine touches of melodrama, for example the attempted murder in the deserted gymnasium, or the strained walk through the woods ending in the murder of the decoy, but in the end we come back to the many, almost choric, scenes in the shop which fix the film’s terrors into a frame of reality that sharply sets them off. This is the technical trick of Hitchcock which used to work so well during his period of British melodramas. For all his extravagance, Hitchcock knew where to stop straining our credulity.  
_The Stranger_ soon outpaced mine. Considering the lone detective possesses every proof of the Nazi’s identity and guilt, it seems incredible he should be left at large to be a danger to innocent people and to come to so destructive an end on the melodramatically designed Gothic bell tower which fascinates him at odd hours of the night, and end by impaling his terror-stricken body on one of its medieval mechanical figures.
