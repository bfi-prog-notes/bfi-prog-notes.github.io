In this, Mike Leigh’s first television drama, Mrs Thornley quietly endures a life of unceasing domestic work: as a char for Mrs Stone and at home for her demanding husband, Jim. Throughout, Mrs Thornley is inarticulate and passive. Her characterisation attracted complaints from left-wing and feminist critics suggesting that, when he derived the character from his middle-class mother’s cleaning lady, Leigh could not imagine a fulfilling life beyond such work. However, although she does not articulate her feelings, Leigh uses cutaway shots of her to comment on others’ attitudes. Furthermore, her apparent passivity serves several dramatic purposes.

Leigh uses visual echoes and parallels to juxtapose Mrs Thornley’s domestic and paid jobs, heightening the play’s exploration of identity as shaped by work and maternal duty (hence the pun in the title) and gender roles across classes and generations. It also heightens Leigh’s wider social point that people’s private lives are so separate that they are often connected only by economic convenience. Leigh acknowledges his position by filming the middle-class Stone in a house two doors away from his old home. He cites _Hard Labour_ as a very personal film which unusually for him touches, albeit marginally, upon his Jewish background.

The play’s closing scenes imply submerged depths beneath Mrs Thornley’s passivity and Jim’s belligerence. Mrs Thornley rubs Jim’s unsightly hairy shoulders, alleviating rheumatic pain but also satisfying his unarticulated need for intimacy and physicality. This leads Mrs Thornley haltingly to discuss her emotional restraint with a priest, who prescribes penance. There follows a lengthy closing shot of Mrs Thornley cleaning windows, implying that penitence motivates her work. This, alongside recurring Catholic imagery, implicates religious guilt in her confused identity and offers active interpretations of her stoical labour, although she does not experience the moments of realisation common to characters in Leigh’s later work.

Reinforcing the play’s political concern with isolation and working-class communities, Leigh heightens confinement and the repetition of mundane tasks through restrictive editing and compositions, including shots which isolate feet and hands at work. Although he retains characteristic features, such as his noted process with actors, he also employs improvised location footage inspired by producer Tony Garnett, a device which he would subsequently avoid. Though more sombre than Leigh’s later work, _Hard Labour_’s visuals, which comment on the action and on modern life’s ironies in an understated, witty way, address a common Leigh theme: limited social and emotional communication.

**Tony Garnett on ‘Hard Labour’**  
In the early 70s I was invited, by people I had never heard of, to a screening. The theatre was empty except for a few cast members. The film was slow and lugubrious. The filmmakers had been helped to finish it by Albert Finney, partly because both they and Albert came from Salford. They did not know how to get it shown or how to get another one started.

You get hunches about people, and something about these unlikely lads attracted me. I was also curious about their working methods. My BBC deal was for four films a year, spread between BBC1 and 2. I rejigged and gave them one each. Sometime later I was joined at the bar of the BBC Club by my boss, the Head of Plays, Gerald Savory.

‘Hello, haven’t seen you for a while. What are you up to?’

This from the man I formally reported to.

‘About to start a couple of films [_Hard Labour_ and _Blooming Youth_]’.

‘Ah, who wrote them?’

‘No one. The directors put a bunch of actors together, improvise for three or four months, and shoot the results. Hopefully.’

He looked puzzled.

‘Interesting. Who are the directors?’

‘You wouldn’t know them. They’re new.’

‘Ah’. Clutching at straws now. ‘The cast?’

‘All unknowns.’

True. Liz Smith, Bernard Hill, Alison Steadman and Ben Kingsley were all unknown then.

‘Well... jolly good luck.’

I then heard nothing from him until I showed the finished films.

This was management by benign neglect. Something we might recommend to McKinseys.

The directors were Mike Leigh and Les Blair. Only the BBC would take that chance. Without a reputation, who would risk funding a cast for months on the off chance there would be a film to shoot at the end? These directors, whose work subsequently enriched our culture, would have been abandoned, depressed and ignored. At the starting gate.

I often wonder if the BBC now is of a mind to do the same for the young, uncategorised talent. I suspect that at best, they would have their originality ironed out of them on _Eastenders_.
