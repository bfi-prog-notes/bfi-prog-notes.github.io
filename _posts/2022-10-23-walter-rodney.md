This documentary explores the life of historian and civil rights campaigner  
Dr Walter Rodney. Filmed in Guyana, Barbados, Jamaica, Tanzania, the US and the UK, featuring revelatory interviews, it examines the life of a man who sought unity in the face of division and whose ideals lie at the heart of global struggles today. Walter Rodney was killed in 1980 in Guyana, South America by the CIA and MI5-supported autocratic government of Forbes Burnham. Forty-one years after his death, the Guyanese government has finally acknowledged the state’s role in his assassination.

Supported by The Walter Rodney Foundation and the Ameena Gafoor Institute.
