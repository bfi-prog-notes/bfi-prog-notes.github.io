_Introduced by Clare Baines (Disability Equality Lead, BFI) and Matthew Hellett, Lead Programmer, Oska Bright Film Festival._

Challenging expectations is at the heart of _Shadow_. A group of activists convene to discuss artificial intelligence and their relationship with it. Sarah, Scott and Simon lead, navigating their contrasting ideas and experiences of being overlooked and disempowered as disabled people. Winning the audience prize at South by Southwest Film Festival, this is a raw, passionate drama from Back to Back Theatre.

Followed by a post screening discussion in NFT3 about the issues raised, in partnership with Oska Bright Film Festival.
