From the Oscar®-winning successes of _Women in Love_ (1969) and _A Touch of Class_ (1973) to the Emmy-winning TV role _Elizabeth R_ (1971), Glenda Jackson’s talent and intensity have burned through big and small screen alike. She served in parliament as a Labour MP from 1992 to 2015 and, perhaps uniquely in the annals of thespian history, made a triumphant return to stage acting at the age of 82, winning a Tony Award and an Evening Standard award. In 2019 Jackson earned a BAFTA upon her return to TV after 25 years, for her role in _Elizabeth Is Missing_.

She talks to BBC Radio 4’s John Wilson.

The screen’s loss was politics’ gain when dominant actress Glenda Jackson successfully stood as Labour MP for Hampstead in 1992, giving herself whole-heartedly to her political responsibilities.

A bricklayer’s daughter, early determined on an acting career, she trained at RADA and first appeared on stage in 1957, her big chance coming in 1964 when Peter Brook cast her as assassin Charlotte Corday in his Theatre of Cruelty production _Marat/Sade_, transferred to the screen in 1966. She would continue to appear on the stage, notably, for the RSC, as Ophelia in Peter Hall’s _Hamlet_ (1965), as _Hedda Gabler_ (1975), filmed as _Hedda_ (d. Trevor Nunn) and with Alan Howard in _Antony and Cleopatra_ (1978).

She can be spotted sitting on a piano in a party scene in _This Sporting Life_  
(d. Lindsay Anderson, 1963), but, apart from the RSC transfers, her film career really began with her magisterial Oscar-winning Gudrun in Ken Russell’s daring adaptation of _Women in Love_ (1969). Her blazing intelligence, sexual challenge and abrasiveness were at the service of a superbly written role in a film with a passion rare in the annals of British cinema.

She came to films just as the bottom was falling out of the domestic industry which makes more remarkable the roles she did get: she vies, with painful conviction (and for a British Academy Award), for a share of Murray Head’s affections in _Sunday Bloody Sunday_ (d. John Schlesinger, 1971); is perhaps the screen’s greatest Elizabeth I, charismatic and commanding, both in _Mary, Queen of Scots_ (d. Charles Jarrott, 1971) and TV’s _Elizabeth R_ (BBC, 1971); a sensual, whorish Emma Hamilton (making Vivien Leigh’s seem like a debutante) in _Bequest to the Nation_ (d. James Cellan Jones, 1973); a sardonic Sister Alexandra in _Nasty Habits_ (d. Michael Lindsay-Hogg, 1976); a tautly moving figure as _Stevie_ [Smith] (d. Robert Enders, 1978); very affecting as the dowdy housewife whose life is disrupted by _The Return of the Soldier_ (d. Alan Bridges, 1982).

Virtually everything is worth noting, including her second Oscar role in  
_A Touch of Class_ (d. Melvin Frank, 1972), the title role in _The Patricia Neal Story_ (d. Anthony Harvey, 1981) and other TV including _A Murder of Quality_ (d. Gavin Millar, 1991). She made a triumphant return to stage acting at the age of 82 and went on to win a BAFTA for _Elizabeth Is Missing_.

Perhaps not since the heyday of Googie Withers was there so potent a British screen actress. Jackson’s brave career choices have left us a marvellous record of her immense talent.
