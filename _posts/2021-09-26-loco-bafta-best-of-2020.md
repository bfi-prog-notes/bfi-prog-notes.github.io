BAFTA-recognised festival LOCO aka The London Comedy Film Festival is back to share the best comedy short films rescued from the madness of 2020 in this Comedy Shorts Weekender, in partnership with MindsEye.

With such a strong field, it has not been easy to come up with a list of the best submissions from this year. However, after much heated debate (and a lot of chuckles), a list has been decided on. These are the films which made us laugh loudest and think hardest. Innovative and playful, this selection of short films represents some of the very best comedy writing, directing and performing.
