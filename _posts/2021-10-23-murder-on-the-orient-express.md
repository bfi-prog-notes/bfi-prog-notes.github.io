**SPOILER WARNING  The following notes give away some of the plot.**

Amid adaptations of Shakespeare, Beatrix Potter and E.M. Forster, the ever-tasteful British producers John Brabourne and Richard Goodwin mined their most profitable seam with a quartet of notably handsome, star-laden Agatha Christie thrillers.

The series sets off on the right track with _Murder on the Orient Express_. Director Sidney Lumet claimed that he wanted ‘glamour, gaiety and humour’, though the film also stokes hemmed-in tension reminiscent of his _12 Angry_ _Men_, as DP Geoffrey Unsworth captures the stuffy, eerie confines of the eponymous snowbound locomotive. Ingrid Bergman won an Oscar for her timorous missionary, while Albert Finney effects the transformation of his career as an unnerving, pin-sharp Poirot.<br>

**A contemporary review**<br>
_Murder on the Orient Express_ dates from 1934, when Agatha Christie was running rings round some of the formulas of ‘classic’ detective fiction. The conventions allow several deaths but only one murderer; Christie pulled a switch by assembling the most internationally assorted group of travelling companions, and revealing them all as guilty of a single crime.

But of course the trick only works fully within a context of the reader’s expectation – looking for clues leading to one killer, he’s bamboozled by an ‘impossible’ crime and then presented with 12 murderers; 12 angry jurors, as in Sidney Lumet’s first film, but jurors who have carried out their own verdict.

The screen has never been much good at classic detection, with its detached deductive processes and apparatus of alibis and time-tables. Here the script, as capably carpentered as might be expected from Paul Dehn, plays a lot fairer by Christie than most adaptations; but the dryness of the mixture, in popular movie terms, demands what the film offers a liberal sprinkling of plums in the casting.

Finney’s Poirot is a succulent _tour de force_ of disguise, including a voice that seems to borrow some distant intonations from the great Sidney Greenstreet and a body that appears to have been strapped into its suit. On the all-star passenger list, Widmark (the victim), Perkins (his secretary) and Gielgud (his manservant) are all more than up to their work; and there’s a _grande dame_ elocution lesson from Wendy Hiller, ordering ‘a poached sole and a potato’, and some chattering entrances from Lauren Bacall, eventually revealed as a great lady of the American stage and Daisy Armstrong’s grandmother.

But the signal success in the casting is Ingrid Bergman, dowdy, tremulous and very Swedish as the missionary lady, managing to create a character as well as a counter in the game. Sidney Lumet steers them capably enough through their paces, finding a few varied angles on the inevitable flashbacks to the fatal night, but letting the proceedings drag both early on, when we keep cutting to shots of the train, and in some of the more laborious explanations and the 12-stab ritual of the killing. By presenting neither more nor less than a puzzle, Agatha Christie dodges moral implications. The film underlines a basic Christie toughness – 12 people get away with murder, however morally justified, to save the railway company embarrassment. The film’s effective prologue (shots of people in the Armstrong case linked with newspaper headlines) implies a more probing enquiry; the cheerful glass-clinking at the end calls time on a rather over-lengthy game.<br>
