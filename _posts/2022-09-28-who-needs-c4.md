The world Channel 4 was born into 40 years ago was very different to today’s: only two UK broadcasters, whole swathes of society unrepresented on the TV screen, precious little edgy or challenging programming. So, in a world of limitless viewer choice, vastly improved on-screen representation, and both streamers and broadcasters offering more challenging and innovative content, what is the role of Channel 4 now? Can it still be a trailblazer and troublemaker over the next 40 years? Chief Content Officer Ian Katz discusses how the DNA created in 1982 still shapes the channel’s output while a panel of stars who have emerged through the modern Channel 4 talk about the role it has played in their careers. There will also be the chance to ask your own questions.

**Ian Katz** is Chief Content Officer of Channel 4. Ian has overall responsibility for the creative output across Channel 4, its portfolio and All 4, leading the creative commissioning team to ensure Channel 4’s unique remit to innovate, take creative risks and represent all of the UK on screen is reflected in its programmes and content.

A South London native with a law degree, **Yinka Bokinni**’s love for music lead her to a dream slot, The Capital Xtra Breakfast Show 6-10am.

The first book, _The Amazing Edie Eckhart_ was published in August 2021, and is a brand new upper middle-grade series written with humour and heart in diary form, which Jacqueline Wilson dubbed a ‘brilliant book – fresh, funny and ultra-cool’. The second in the series, _The Amazing Edie Eckhart: The Big Trip_, is due for release in August 2022.
