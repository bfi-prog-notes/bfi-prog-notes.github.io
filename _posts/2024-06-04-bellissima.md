It is unfortunate that _Bellissima_ is not better known outside Italy, as it is a film which, in addition to its merits as an antidote to _La terra trema_, confounds a number of stereotypes that have been built up round Visconti’s work and artistic personality. It is, in a vulgar sense, the most obviously ‘Italian’ of all his films, with extremely rapid dialogues which are difficult to translate and a _fortiori_ almost impossible to subtitle without totally losing the flavour of the original. But it is the most subtle and elusive thing of all, the element of self-criticism and irony at the expense of its own ‘Italian’ quality, which has most effectively prevented it from being assimilated and appreciated by foreign audiences. For at its highest level it is a denial of all stereotypes, about Visconti, about Italian films in general, about neo-realism, and even about that sacred monster, Anna Magnani, who is the star of the film.

_Bellissima_ opens with a piece of apparently gratuitous bravura – a radio concert performance of a Donizetti opera. The camera prowls among the sopranos of the chorus, middle-aged dowdy maidens and matrons grotesquely miming the mood of an unseen romantic action. This suggestive reverie is brusquely interrupted by the intercutting of the brash voice of a radio announcer, giving details of a competition for ‘la più bella bambina di Roma’ – ‘the prettiest little girl in Rome’ – wanted for a star part in a new film. Given Visconti’s well-known love of opera and the subsequent development of the satire on the world of Cinecittà, the contrast is clearly double-edged but on balance favourable to the old-fashioned world of the opera. As the unprepossessing ladies of the chorus mouth the word ‘bel-lis-si-ma’ the image evoked is one of a misty ideal beauty, transcending the banal physical circumstances in which the image is produced – a sharp contrast between the product and the means of production which Visconti maintains in relation to the cinema throughout the film. Even the idea, however, of the ‘prettiest little girl in Rome’ exists only on the level of the most extreme vulgarity.

Much of the significance of this opening credits sequence is, however, only latent. Its immediate function is simply to establish a tone of gentle asperity, which is maintained, more or less evenly, throughout the film. The aspirant Shirley Temples and their mums swarm into the studios, with Anna Magnani, struggling wildly in the middle, looking frantically for her mislaid daughter. The errant infant is discovered playing quite happily by itself near an ornamental pool in the studio grounds, and when her mother approaches her and begins to fuss over her and scold her, there starts up a mad operatic duet between a screaming and shouting Magnani and a tearful, bawling child who does not understand in the least what any of the fuss is all about. Most of the humour of the film is centred round the themes announced in this episode, the different and conflicting forms of irrationality and non-rationality in the behaviour of the monstrous gaggle of middle-class mums, of Magnani herself, and of the little girl, Maria.

Unlike the other mothers, Anna Magnani is a ‘donna del popolo’ – a ‘woman of the people’. This ‘people’ is not actually an invention of neo-realism as malicious critics have suggested. As a class, or non-class, comprehending broad strata of the population, it does exist, though more in literature than in real life. Broadly speaking, it designates everyone who is not rich, bourgeois or upper class, whether shopkeepers, manual or white-collar workers, or nothing in particular. Some elements of a partly fictitious class stereotype, probably due to Zavattini, who wrote the script, have crept into the figuration of the character played by Magnani in _Bellissima_, but basically, largely because of Visconti’s attention to untypical detail, the representation is autonomous and real and points a vivid but not implausible contrast between Magnani’s character and that of the world to which the others belong.

Her husband is an amiable, commonsensical man, with a steady but ill-paid job and not many ambitions, least of all the extravagant wish that his child should become a national figure. Ambition, coupled with a slight naïve snobbery, becomes her province, and it is channelled through the child. With no particular illusions about her competence she calls herself a nurse, which means that she picks up money going round giving injections to hypochondriacs, of whom she knows a good many. Her vision of the world is dominated by the movies and by the ambitions she has for Maria. The role of the movies in this vision is providential, almost supernatural. They are not only a passion but a hope for miraculous advancement, either through fortune (like the lottery in Naples) or skill (like football in Rio). Magnani’s slavery to the cinema dream and her superstitious hope have a background in popular life and help yet again to mark her off from the other mothers whose attitudes display a calculating bourgeois rationality. Times are changing, and what they have done is to transfer their ambitions from the middle-class world of theatre and ballet, to which they belong, on to a world which has the simple advantage of being quantitatively more lucrative, and which they mistakenly assume to be a part of their birthright.

In general, the more a character emerges as an individual, the more sympathy is accorded them. Even the episodic figures like the absurd, parasitic, out-of-work actress who battens on Magnani and persuades her to let her give Maria some lessons in acting are not seen as entirely grotesque. Comic hostility is reserved for the undifferentiated herd, particularly the mums. Real hostility, and not even comic, occurs only in the scenes involving the tycoons and parasites of the industry. It is here that a latent sense of violence and cruelty in Visconti’s approach comes, rather uneasily, to light, together with a curious attitude to laughter as a manifestation, not of amusement, but of aggressive isolation.

Bernard Shaw once made an observation to the effect that extreme happiness produces tears, and extreme unhappiness laughter. With Visconti, tears are the product of extreme human emotion, and often, specifically, of deeply felt solidarity with someone else or of pity. Laughter, which occurs frequently in his films (the most quoted example is the laughter of Tancredi and Angelica at the dinner-table in _The Leopard_), is by contrast aggressive, always an expression of isolation, often of fear or hate. In _Bellissima_ the laughter is pure cruelty. It has nothing to do with the gentle art of comedy, nor even with bitter sarcasm. It is the only moment in the film in which brutality breaks through to the surface.
