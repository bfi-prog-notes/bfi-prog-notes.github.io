**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

Based on a true story, _The Heiresses_ is the first time Mészáros used a period setting. Isabelle Huppert plays Irén, a quiet Jewish shop girl employed by a rich but sterile woman (Monori) to have a baby for her. In pre-WWII Hungary their plan goes well, but as relationships change and fascism rises, further challenges are in store...<br>

The subject of infertility always fascinated Márta Mészáros. In 1936, the wealthy, barren Szilvia ‘buys’ her beautiful, intelligent but impecunious friend Irén, so that her husband, Ákos, the handsome officer, can get her pregnant and the resulting child will inherit the vast fortune. Ákos, who has his wife to thank for his career, initially wants nothing to do with the idea but eventually he cannot resist the charms and refinement of the beautiful Irén.

In 1944, with the rise of the Hungarian fascist party, Szilvia takes terrible revenge against her one-time Jewish friend.

After the world hit of _Nine Months_, Márta Mészáros had the opportunity to shoot a film with another great French film star Isabelle Huppert, in a coproduction with Gaumont. The film, which is based on a true story, was the first where the director positions her typical ‘female theme’ into a historical perspective.

‘When Ákos, the progenitor, earlier screens the footage of a film he has shot of the three of them at a mountain retreat, Szilvia’s head and torso appear on screen while Irén  is shown entering the room so that the two halves make up a single woman in the frame, in a visual fusion reminiscent of Bergman’s melding of two women also locked together _in extremis,_ in _Persona_ (1961). But in a gesture suggesting a desire for a rupture with the past, Szilvia reacts to this recording of the true lovers by throwing the can of film into the fire.’
