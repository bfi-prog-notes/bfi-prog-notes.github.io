_+ intro by Alan Friswell, the conserver and restorer of Ray Harryhausen’s models (Sunday 4 August only)_

When Sinbad and his crew find a piece of golden tablet carried by a tiny winged creature, they are soon pitted against the dark magic of Koura, a formidable sorcerer. The tablet, when complete, forms a map that leads to unimaginable treasures.

The sword-wielding, six-armed Kali, a gryphon and a centaur are just some of the Harryhausen creations that these foolhardy souls meet on their thrilling adventure.

In a sense, this Sinbad ﬁlm began many years ago, when an American teenager was taken by his mother to see a ﬁlm that had just been released. All she knew in advance was that it was about a gorilla, and since her son liked gorillas, she was certain that he would enjoy it.

In fact, it turned out to be more than a matter of enjoyment, because the ﬁlm was _King Kong_ and the teenager was Ray Harryhausen. For Harryhausen, the experience of seeing _King Kong_ was ‘a startling revelation’, and the beginning of a lifetime’s career. ‘To see the way that Kong and the dinosaur moved was the illusion of a lifetime. I came out of that cinema stunned and haunted’, he recalled years later. ‘I expected Kong to be played by a man in a gorilla suit, but that is not what I saw.’

What stunned Harryhausen in _King Kong_ was Willis O’Brien’s technique of stop-motion photography as a way of bringing miniature rubber models to life. A few years later he got a job as one of O’Brien’s assistants, and learned the stop-motion craft himself, with the result that in 1949 he shared with O’Brien the credit for the special visual effects on another gorilla picture, _Mighty Joe Young_.

These gorilla ﬁlms were however in black and white, and Harryhausen set himself the task of developing O’Brien’s process so that it could be used with colour, and with mythological creatures as well as zoological ones. The ﬁrst fruit of this quest was the 1958 Technicolor ﬁlm _The Seventh Voyage of Sinbad_, which was an overwhelming public success. At that time Harryhausen called his process Dynamation – a mixture of the words ‘dynamic’ and ‘animation’ – but by the time today’s sequel was produced he had changed it to Dynarama.

One of the Dynarama creations that Sinbad meets on his Golden Voyage is Kali, who serves well as an example of Harryhausen’s approach. Kali is the Goddess of Destruction in Indian mythology, and is usually portrayed in Indian paintings as having four arms, and a belt of jangling skulls. Harryhausen had long wanted to bring her to life, and steered this screenplay so that it gave him his chance. In putting Kali on the screen he left out the jangling skulls but, perhaps to compensate for this omission, made his task of animating her even more difﬁcult than it need have been by giving her six sword-wielding arms rather than four.

The staging of the sword ﬁght between Kali and the sailors was a complicated operation. The actors had to learn to ﬁght an opponent who was not there, because at that time the bronze, six-armed, eight-foot statue existed only as a design on Harryhausen’s drawing board. Months later Harryhausen turned his Kali design into a one-foot jointed model, blending her movements with those of the live-action sailors, and making her look taller than them.

Because Dynarama was such a time-consuming business, each ﬁlm made by Harryhausen and producer Charles Schneer used to be in production for up to three years. This made them very expensive, but Schneer and Harryhausen refused to cut corners. As Schneer explained: ‘When you combine the real with the unreal, the audience must think that _everything_ is real. If they don’t, we’ve failed.’
