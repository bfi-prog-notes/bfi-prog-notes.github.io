**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

In Werner Herzog the conquistadorial spirit lives again. He sets out to discover new worlds in the manner of a Renaissance explorer navigating by the stars and waging titanic and by now legendary battles with the elements. _Aguirre_ is the classic example of filmmaking’s new willingness to get its hands dirty, but the subject was such a tailor-made vehicle for Herzog’s trailblazing approach that it achieved an intensity which was the measure of his quest. But even when they are not epic tales, all Herzog’s major films to date have been intellectual adventures (though he would undoubtedly challenge the adjective). And in _Heart of Glass_ this restless need to experiment which often pushes Herzog to eccentricity led him to place the cast under hypnosis. The procedure has already made the film somewhat notorious, but it is justified in the event by lending a superbly somnambulistic quality to the acting out of visions which have more in common with Romantic idealism than modern forms of artistic commitment.

_Heart of Glass_ returns to the period and setting of [_The Enigma of_] _Kaspar Hauser_. It is not a conventional narrative sequel, except to the extent that a tale from the age of revolutions is the logical follow-up to one from the age of rationalism. But the historical perspective is important in providing a moment when the beginnings of capitalism and millenarian visions combine naturally. In saying that the film was ‘about the end of factories, like the world has seen the end of castles’ Herzog seems to have suggested that the world would be turned upside down. Yet _Heart of Glass_ could not less resemble the ecological tract he would appear to have had in mind originally; its political meaning is a faint rumble in the distance, and it is held together by the power of its visions.

The story concerns, essentially, a community in Bavaria at about the turn of the 19th century which lives by the manufacture of an extremely precious ruby glass. The factory foreman dies and with him the secret of making the glass, and the factory owner is forced to search desperately – and unsuccessfully – for the formula without which he and the community cannot live. Hias, a cowherd who spends much time in deep meditation in the surrounding mountains, has a power of vision which is so extraordinary that he has become something of a sage among the locals. He can predict who will cross a mountain bridge and which of the evening drinkers in the inn will be dead on the following morning. But his strongest visions are apocalyptic: he sees fire and destruction, he sees the earth’s crust crumbling, plague, famine, the fall of the Church in Italy, the last man running in agony through the deserted village after the holocaust. He is unable and probably unwilling to help the factory owner discover the secret of the glass, in the same way that the owner cannot be deflected from his search to organise the bear-hunting party Hias asks for. Ultimately, both Hias and the owner land in prison, where their affinity is revealed: Hias has foretold the factory’s destruction by fire while the owner has actually set it alight in the moment of exaltation which follows the murder of his servant girl Ludmilla.

But _Heart of Glass_ is not really a narrative film. The tale of the factory is simply a narrative counterpoint, though it is realised in splendid detail. Herzog takes time off for a number of low-life scenes in the factory and the inn where the lighting and detail of composition are reminiscent of genre painting. His interest in how things work extends to observing craftsmen blowing glass, while the grotesque takes the form of a strip performed by the village idiot on a table in the inn. There are indications that Herzog originally intended to heighten this local colour and emphasise the conventional narrative by ending _Heart of Glass_ on the murder of the servant girl. But as the film now stands, it bears far more resemblance to a folk tale, with all the ellipsis and irrationality that the supernatural element allows. It is not even a film about visions, but a film of visions which are realised by Hias and articulate all the sequences. It opens with his view of mists rolling down a mountain valley like the waters of the deluge, and closes with his projection of lonely men standing on a remote outcrop in the sea gazing westward as a small boat sets out from the old world on a doomed expedition into the future. Because of this, _Heart of Glass_ is a film in which point of view is systematically blurred – is it what Hias sees? Is it what really happens? – but which has the irrational logic of dreams. Herzog is the sworn enemy of intellectualism and claims that the cinema has more to do with popular entertainment than with scholarship. So _Heart of Glass_ might be seen as another attempt to recapture the naivete of _Kaspar Hauser_, and to recreate the folk mentality through the productions of what is literally a dream factory.

There is no doubt that _Heart of Glass_ is marked by Herzog’s private obsessions: grotesques and overreachers especially. It may be no accident that the factory owner lusts for ruby glass as a vampire lusts for blood, but it is nevertheless a very oblique attack on property. It is also tempting to see the film as a recapitulation of the German Romantic tradition. But beyond any interpretation, what makes it stunning are the moments when Herzog stops filming and starts to paint. Sometimes Hias is the shepherd reclining in the corner of a Romantic landscape with, behind him, torrents and ravines straight from John Martin; sometimes he is the hireling shepherd looking into a distance composed of streaks of Pre-Raphaelite gaudiness; and most often he is  St. Jerome musing on the emblems of mortality. Herzog is far too much of a maverick to allow us to see universal significance in these moments. He is very much the visionary outsider that Hias is. But it’s the vision that counts in  the end.
