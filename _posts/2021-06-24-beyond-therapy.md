**SPOILER WARNING  The following notes give away some of the plot.**

The span between the 1980 ‘catastrophe’ of _HealtH_ and _Popeye_ and the 1992 ‘comeback’ of _The Player_ is often regarded as Robert Altman’s ‘wilderness years.’ In point of fact, the former are more interesting films than the latter, but in narrativising careers we leave little room for distinguishing between financial setbacks and creative accomplishments. And the noteworthy thing about these wilderness years is not that they were a negligible sidelining, but that they produced some work that was really, really wild.

Along with a venomous foray into the teen movie (_O.C. and Stiggs_, 1985), Altman’s 80s were largely occupied with forays into television (_Tanner ’88_ in 1988, _Vincent & Theo_ in 1990) and theatre, both directing for the stage and filming stage work. _Beyond Therapy_ belongs to the last-named category, based on Christopher Durang’s off-Broadway hit, though significantly rewritten by Altman, to the displeasure of Durang, who wrote that Altman ‘throws the psychological underpinnings out the window, and people just run around acting “crazy”.’ This is not inaccurate, nor is it a demerit for those with a fondness for the screwball tradition who never worried too much about how John Barrymore and Carole Lombard in _Twentieth Century_ (1934) got  
that way.

Here we’ve got an ensemble of zanies that fans out around a central triangular relationship consisting of Bob (Christopher Guest); his bisexual live-in boyfriend, Bruce (Jeff Goldblum); and the girl Bruce meets through a personal ad in _New York Magazine_, Prudence (Julie Hagerty, one of our finest comediennes). On their first date, Bruce sucks Prudence’s toe unbidden, and soon after proffers: ‘I was gonna take you to see a revival of _The Tree of Wooden Clogs_, then home to my place for sexual intercourse?’ The rapid-fire discourse of dizzy dysfunctionals scarcely lets up from here, and what might have been a cosy yuppie comedy of manners turns into something nearer to Antonin Artaud, the aggression overlaid with a strange sweetness. (Various renditions of ‘Someone to Watch over Me’ act as the film’s theme song.)  
Manic and moony, it’s the film of someone with nothing left to lose, redolent of the freedom of the wilderness.<br>

Robert Altman’s _Beyond Therapy_ ends its comedy of acting out, of private dramas that only seem to have meaning in public places, with what might be called a tourist pirouette. As the central duo, Bruce (Jeff Goldblum) and Prudence (Julie Hagerty) leave the restaurant where more acting out than eating has been going on, talking of marriage and a trip to Paris, the camera drifts up and away from them to come to rest on the city skyline. It’s one of those conventional images for signalling a happy ending, except that this skyline is not New York, as we have been led to believe, but Paris itself – with the Eiffel Tower, most conventionally but in this context most surprisingly, parked in the middle of the shot. Since we have gone in one unbroken pan from the restaurant to the cityscape, the trickery, or the joke (like falling in love, the characters only have to wish themselves in Paris, and bingo they’re there), can’t be in the shot itself. It’s in the way the film is set up from the beginning, part of its structure and its theme.

Altman is not ambiguous about where the story is set; he deliberately leads us astray. In the first scene, Bruce is waiting outside the French restaurant,  
Les Bouchons, where all his and Prudence’s subsequent assignations will take place, albeit under different names. She arrives a moment later, struggling out of an unmistakable New York subway, dropping the copy of New York magazine which carries the lonely hearts ad from Bruce she has answered (a passer-by picks it up; she thanks him; he calmly walks off with it). Her nervousness is not exactly allayed by the first minutes of conversation with Bruce: he tells her about the man he’s currently living with, but that he’s willing to consider marriage.

Added to which, their rendezvous has attracted the excited interest of a parrot-dressed woman dining upstairs. Zizi (Geneviève Page) is obviously French, but she seems to be in charge of a group of similarly vibrantly dressed American women, and when she can no longer stand what she sees going on downstairs, she leads them all out with a great deal of flapping and backtalking (no more American Express, protest the staff as they try to pay). Zizi turns out to be the mother of Bob (Christopher Guest), who is Bruce’s current live-in lover, and when she tells him about this betrayal, Bob leads his whole therapy group in indignant invasion of Les Bouchons. Before this, however, many people have had recourse to their therapists. One of the waiters weeps down the phone to Charlotte (Glenda Jackson), who asks about his phoney French accent. Bruce is another of Charlotte’s patients, while next door Prudence is seeing her colleague Stuart (Tom Conti), whose therapeutic style includes  
an aggrieved defensiveness about his own sexuality, conveyed in a thick, Italianate accent.

In one sense, what this adds up to is a conventional enough comedy in which the therapists are crazier than their patients, with all the farcical toing-and-froing intensified by everyone’s self-consciousness about their ‘problems’. Bruce and Prudence’s romance negotiates this new minefield, with their first meeting ending in hostile disarray, after which Bruce readvertises, under a different name and personal description, only to find himself dating Prudence in Les Bouchons again. Finally, a confused convocation of therapists and patients in the restaurant convinces them that the only sane thing is to escape together to Paris. Where, we then discover, they have been all along.

What this peculiar little pirouette, this double-handedness about the setting, does is to give all the agonising about identity an objective cast, a social reality that is itself a riddle. Either these characters are in New York, in which case all the foreign pretensions, the French food and phoney accents, are one sign of displacement and uncertainty. Or they’re in Paris, in which case the ‘phoneyness’ is real and it’s the characters who are displaced. This bifurcated view is a new way of opening out a stage play by multiplying the worlds it inhabits. It’s also a clue to the secret processes of Altman, to the way he often seems to be taking away with one hand what he gives with the other, conferring a poignant sense of social reality on the desert chimeras of  
_3 Women_, or treating Raymond Chandler’s hero in _The Long Goodbye_ as  
both a knight errant out of his time and a self-indulgent slob who can’t get his act together.

Philip Marlowe’s situation might be relevant here, since he seems to be the Altman character who was previously most out of sync with reality, and who therefore might have benefited most from therapy. And the new film does at one point deliver the therapeutic goods, when Bob, driven to distraction by Bruce’s habit of complicating their life together with women, is left off in Charlotte’s consulting room. She, responding in her apparently usual oblivious fashion with a vituperative tirade about gays, provokes him into ‘shooting’ her with the blanks in a starter’s pistol. Immediately claiming this as a breakthrough, she takes him off to Les Bouchons, and puts her fingers in her ears as Bob blazes away at Bruce and Prudence, the scene turning into a delightfully funny slow-motion orgy of seeming violence as therapeutic reality and movie fantasy mesh.<br>

**Les Boréades**

Altman’s characteristically inventive contribution to producer Don Boyd’s opera compilation film _Aria_ centres on an audience enjoying (?) Rameau’s music.
