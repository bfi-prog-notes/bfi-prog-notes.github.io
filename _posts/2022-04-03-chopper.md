**Out of the Unknown**<br>
In 1962 the ITV company ABC aired a science fiction anthology series, _Out of This World_. It was a high-profile production and was well received. Two years later, the creative force behind the series, Sydney Newman, became head of the BBC’s fledgling drama department, which was facing a 40% increase in output due to the creation of a new channel, BBC2. Pressed for ideas, Newman returned to the concept of an anthology series of science fiction and fantasy plays.

The result was _Out of the Unknown_ (BBC, 1965-71, 49 episodes), a mixture of original screenplays and adaptations of stories by distinguished authors including Isaac Asimov, J.G. Ballard, Ray Bradbury, Robert Sheckley and Frederick Pohl. Nigel Kneale, famous for writing the 1950s Quatermass adventures, also contributed a script, _The Chopper_, for the show’s fourth and final season.<br>
