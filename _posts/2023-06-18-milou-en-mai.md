Set in the South in peacetime, teeming with characters, full of jokes and sly allusions, sunny and mischevious, a comedy not a tragedy, _Milou en mai_ might seem to confirm Louis Malle’s sometime reputation as a maverick. Certainly, he was never a card-carrying _Cahiers du Cinéma_ activist: but he was at least on the fringes of the New Wave, and Truffaut valued him highly, especially for _Zazie dans le metro_ – ‘_un film follement ambitieux et d’un courage immense_’.  In fact, _Milou en mai_ is also madly ambitious, and its boldness in teasing a cherished theme has led to attacks on it in France.

Once again, cliché plays a part: this time, the vultures who gather to hear the reading of a will. The deceased is an old lady (Paulette Dubost) whose 60-year-old son Milou (Michel Piccoli) has been happily neglecting the family estate in the Gers, to the west of Toulouse. His bucolic pleasures – fishing, beekeeping, bedding his housekeeper – are interrupted when the relatives descend. They include a selfish, dishy blonde daughter (Miou-Miou), an anxious brother, an English in-law (Harriet Walter) and an angry lesbian niece. The will, as always, is a disappointment and a bone to pick: but more embarrassing is the fact that this is May 1968. In faraway Paris, the radio reports student riots; and even here in the South-West the gravediggers have gone on strike.

So Madame lies in state in the library – until rumours of revolution, even in this rustic enclave, spook the family into taking to the woods. Out they all traipse, with aspirins, laxatives and other essentials, incongruous as the tottery ladies on their high heels in some Jacques Tati farce. Then they, too, are infected by the spirit of the May _événements_. They dream of living the simple life. They share a joint, puffing like gaffers. They grope inconclusively towards free love.

In the end, of course, convention is re-established. The local capitalist even poisons a stream. Precious possessions, it’s clear, will be scattered and wasted on greedy heirs: only the housekeeper, an unexpected legatee who now plans to marry her young fiancé, will really benefit from the will. As for Milou, who knows? His lazy stoicism, superbly conveyed by Piccoli, never so relaxed and florid, will probably enable him to enjoy his remaining years.

On the surface, then, this is a cheerful picture, endorsing scapegrace pastoral values, with even some nods towards ecological Greens. It includes incidental felicities: a swarm of bees writhing on a peasant’s head and shoulders, a dizzy tracking shot of a bicycle ride, a sweet modulation from seemingly classical violin music into the joyous syncopation of Stéphane Grappelli. Yet, on analysis, the film’s depiction of the _bourgeoisie de province_ is no less scathing than in some of Chabrol’s movies; and its real subject, like that of _Une affaire de femmes_, is treated mainly offscreen. What _Milou en mai_ is saying, in fact, is what attracted hostility in Paris: that the 1968 student riots, as Raymond Aron was reviled for pointing out, were chiefly an intoxicating charade. For nostalgic _soixant-huitards_, this was an unwelcome message, hardly compatible with their notion of _la Nouvelle Vague_.

In reality, questioning received wisdom was always the New Wave’s habit; and in his best films of the last 20 years, Louis Malle has quietly and firmly done just that. _Lacombe Lucien_, in 1974, blew up a storm of protest because naïve viewers thought it an apology for wartime collaboration. _Au revoir les enfants_, painfully autobiographical, hinted at guilt and self-accusation for adolescent insouciance. And when I last saw Malle he was musing about a film on the _épuration_, the postwar settling of Occupation scores. There seems nothing conformist about such prickly, uncomfortable concerns. In that respect, the New Wave lives on.
