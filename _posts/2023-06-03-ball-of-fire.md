Snow White trades purity for one-liners and innuendo in this madcap comedic update. While hiding from the police, Sugarpuss O’Shea educates a group of stuffy professors on the ways of the world while assisting on their encyclopaedia of slang. Barbara Stanwyck’s vibrancy lights up the screen as she runs rings around her co-stars, investing warmth and humour in every knowing glance.

_Ball of Fire_ roots its comic impetus more firmly in the richer, older, more affectionate territory of Manhattan folklore. The story, a tightly-knit amalgam of toughness, crackle and exclusively American sentimentality, tells of the impact of a boogie-woogie singer (Barbara Stanwyck) and her gangster lover on eight learned professors – seven likeable character actors and Gary Cooper – engaged in compiling an encyclopaedia. Having dealt with Saltpetre and Sex, they break their record of nine years' cloistered research by undertaking a first-hand investigation into Slang. The contrast between a confident, cynical, violent underworld and the deferential society of the common-room was never new; but the execution here is sparkling. Inspired by what must have seemed a piquant variation on his theme of the all-male community, Hawks directs with a faultless sense of timing and surprise. The robust, picturesque script by Charles Brackett and Billy Wilder assimilates a number of intramural jokes into the plot fabric, notably the roaring machine-gun intervention in Stanwyck’s unwilling wedding to her gangster, identical to a shoot-up scene in _Scarface_ and here given an extra twist by having the finger of the meekest of the professors on the trigger. The sets, including the _Magnificent Ambersons_-type house where the professors work, are impeccably detailed; the groupings beautifully composed, lit, and shot in depth by Gregg Toland; indeed the whole thing has all the density necessary to carry its superstructure of fantasy.

How Joe Lilac is outwitted by the academic team makes a magnificent climax to a film which is amusing for two hours on end. The plot is ordinary but not the direction, the dialogue or the acting, all of which are in the first rank. The professors are a joy and Gary Cooper makes Potts as attractive as he is inarticulate, while Barbara Stanwyck scintillates as Sugarpuss. The situations are farcical but the result is great comedy.
