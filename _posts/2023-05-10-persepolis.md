Based on Marjane Satrapi’s autobiographical graphic novels about a young girl growing up in Tehran around the time of the 1979 Iranian revolution, the big-screen _Persepolis_ – which Satrapi co-directed with Vincent Paronnaud – zigzags between past and present, Iran and Europe, to create a deliciously mischievous portrait of life in exile. Satrapi’s heroine Maui travels between colour and black and white, where colour represents the drab present of airport lounges and a rootless existence.

‘It’s not easy to squeeze 16 years of life into 90 minutes,’ says Satrapi. ‘Some people have thought the colour in the film represents Europe and Iran is black and white, but that’s not the case. Colour does not represent happiness – it was more a code to make people understand the use of flashback.’

The action opens with a grown-up Marji waiting in Paris’ Orly airport, where the plumes of smoke from her ever-present cigarette transport her to her past in pre-revolutionary Iran. In 2D black-and-white animation we see a pre-teen Marji stomp around her parents’ apartment, showing off her kung-fu prowess in homage to Bruce Lee. Her intellectual, middle-class parents Tadji and Ebi eagerly await the fall of the Shah and the promise of greater freedoms, while the girl’s grandmother feeds Marji a steady diet of worldly irreverence.

With the arrival of the revolution, however, the frames become filled with the silhouettes of young men, foregrounded against a clamouring mob, throwing stones at helmeted riot police, and then more plumes of smoke, this time from the teargas pellets launched by the representatives of the Shah’s doomed regime. ‘This was a revolution everyone believed in at the start,’ says Satrapi. ‘It was only when wearing a veil became compulsory in school that I understood there were changes coming. They were horrifying changes, but we were children and we played at making fun of the ideology. And then the Iran-Iraq war came.’

It is at such moments, as hope is replaced by a dawning fear, that the ‘old-school’ hand-drawn 2D animation of _Persepolis_ works most vividly, capturing a country cloaked in chadors and terror as Ayatollah Khomeini’s mullahs consolidate their grip on power in the wake of Saddam Hussein’s western-backed attack. Satrapi and Paronnaud – an underground French comic-book artist who frequently works under the pseudonym of Winshluss – deftly contrast the everyday adventures of Marji and her classmates, their faces now framed by the oval of the hijab, with the brutality of the Islamic regime’s purges, as bearded heavies assassinate political dissenters. There are also poignant depictions of young Iranian men sent to martyrdom in the minefields, plastic keys to paradise around their necks: the distant murmur of the battlefield is overwritten by the hollow sound of exploding corpses before a final freeze-frame captures one soul’s ascent from earth, his extended limbs bordered by a kapow-style firebomb.

Marji’s political maturation comes through conversations with her uncle Anouche, a communist forever in hiding or in prison who regales her with tales of Marx and the proletariat uprising. But Satrapi sidesteps political dogma or didacticism with such images as the young Marji imagining herself in conversation with the father of communism, his billowing white hair and beard conjuring a cross between Santa Claus and God, or nestling on a cloud between Marx and God as the two work to restore her faith in humanity.  
‘I don’t believe you can fight one form of fanaticism with another form of fanaticism,’ she says. ‘We have to use logic and pragmatism. If the goal of fanaticism is to push a button and produce an emotional response, the goal of anti-fanaticism should be the opposite. If fanaticism has the answer to everything, our duty is to ask questions.’

When _Persepolis_ won the Jury Prize at Cannes in 2007 – an award it shared with Carlos Reygadas’ _Silent Light_ – a cultural advisor to Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad accused France of stirring up Islamophobia. That protest came only days after the head of the government-affiliated Farabi Cinema Foundation sent a letter to the French cultural attaché in Tehran claiming the French-backed film presented ‘an unreal picture of the outcomes and achievements of the Islamic revolution.’ _Persepolis_ was withdrawn as opening film at the Bangkok International Film Festival, reportedly after pressure from the Iranian embassy in Thailand, and it has been denied a release in Lebanon for fear it may provoke unrest among supporters of the Iranian-backed Hezbollah.

Yet far from being anti-Iranian, _Persepolis_ plays as a heartfelt paean to Satrapi’s homeland. Indeed if anything, it’s her adopted home of Europe that comes off worse, with British culpability for the political situation made clear as one image shows a marionette-like UK intelligence agent manoeuvring the Shah’s father into power. And on a personal level Marji finds the French Lycée in Vienna where she’s sent at age 14 to keep her out of trouble with the authorities casually racist and insipid in comparison with life in Tehran, where her parents and their friends hold illicit parties with flowing alcohol and black-market salesman hawk contraband copies of Pink Floyd cassettes.

‘I never went to as many parties as I did in Iran,’ says Satrapi. ‘In France going to a party meant sitting around a table talking about politics: no food, no dancing, no music, nothing. In Iran we went to the hairdressers before, we made ourselves up, had lots of food and drink. But when it came down to a question of freedom of expression and thinking, these were things I couldn’t deal with. If I can’t say what I want, if I can’t behave in a way that I am, if I have to lie to myself everyday, then it is not a life. This is why I left.’

During our interview Satrapi oscillates between serious and playful, and _Persepoils_ too transcends its potential bleakness to offer a joyous celebration of Iran and Iranians, symbolised by the jasmine flowers whose scent pervades Marji’s grandmother’s bra and which cascade down the screen at the end of the final scene.

_Persepolis_ was the name given to the 6th-century city founded by Darius I and destroyed by Alexander the Great. ‘In order to understand what is happening you have to have some historical depth,’ says Satrapi. ‘Before the revolution we had a country with a king and a queen and flying carpets. After 1979 the king and queen become guardians of the revolution and the flying carpets become rockets. So we are stuck between these images.’ With characteristic iconoclasm, though, she can’t help but add a final remark about why she chose her title. ‘_Persepolis_ is an easy name to remember.’
