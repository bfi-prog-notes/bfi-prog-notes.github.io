The mid-20th-century golden age of Japanese cinema emerged from a country in the throes of dramatic and irreversible transformation. In this richly illustrated talk, season co-programmer Alexander Jacoby will explore how Japanese filmmakers dramatised and commented on the changing circumstances, lifestyles, values and norms of a nation as it endured the traumas of the war period, before emerging into an increasingly prosperous post-war era.

**Alexander Jacoby** lectures on the arts and culture of Japan, including film, manga and anime, at Oxford Brookes University. He is the author of _A Critical Handbook of Japanese Film Directors_ (2008, Stone Bridge Press) and of a forthcoming monograph on Hirokazu Koreeda, to be published by the BFI and Bloomsbury in 2022. His scholarly essays include contributions to _Japanese Cinema: Texts and Contexts_ (2007, ed. Phillips and Stringer) and  
_The Japanese Cinema Book_ (2020, ed. Fujiki and Phillips), and his journalism on film and other topics has appeared in various publications including _Sight and Sound_, _The Times_ and _The Japan Times_. He has curated film programmes at the BFI, Il Cinema Ritrovato, Bologna, the Giornate del Cinema Muto, Pordenone, and the Museum of Modern Art, New York.
