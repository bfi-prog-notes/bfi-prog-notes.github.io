_+ discussion with filmmaker and writer Imruh Bakari, writer, critic and historian Rianna Jade Parker and musician and educator Deirdre Pascall. Host is Xavier Alexandre Pillai, BFI National Archive Curator._

In this groundbreaking and rare account of the 1980 Notting Hill Carnival, the filmmakers weave together a range of performances from reggae bands Aswad, Sons of Jah and Brimstone, amongst many others. Interspersed between them are interviews with the artists about their lyrics and music, and conversations with audience members about their lives and experiences. The result is a powerful documentary of the Black community in Ladbroke Grove at the beginning of the 1980s.
