BAFTA-recognised festival LOCO aka The London Comedy Film Festival is back to share the best comedy short films rescued from the madness of 2020 in this Comedy Shorts Weekender, in partnership with MindsEye.

After a hell of a year, what could be better than meeting up with old friends? Featuring some of our favourites from previous festivals, this selection of short comedy films comes from veteran LOCO filmmakers and contributors. Featuring a man in search of an ending, some historical re-enactors in need of a lift, and a midwife in danger of ruining the miracle of birth.
