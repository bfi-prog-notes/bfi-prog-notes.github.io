_+ Q&A with director Daniel Kokotajlo and actors Morfydd Clark and Robert Emms_

**Daniel Kokotajlo on ‘Starve Acre’**  

_What first drew you to Andrew Michael Hurley’s novella?_

I like Andrew’s affinity for gothic storytelling, and by that I mean the feeling of unease you experience when you don’t quite know what it is you’re getting into – the anxiety that comes with reading something different and strange – this is something I’ve tried to emulate in the film. I also connected to Andrew’s appreciation of northern landscapes, his chilling atmosphere and attention to detail. _Starve Acre_ had all these elements but also a simple but effective symbol in the brown hare. I’ve always been intrigued by the role of the hare in different cultures and beliefs, and its connection to springtime and spiritual rebirth.

_How did you find the process of adapting the novella for screen?_

The process wasn’t dissimilar to writing original material. I took the elements that I felt were visual and dramatic in Andrew’s novel (much like how I would with any story or idea) and found ways to make them work in a feature length format. I had the opportunity to expand and alter some of the story and characters to connect them to themes that I felt were relevant for how the script was evolving.

_How did the process of writing and directing_ Starve Acre _feel different to your first feature,_ Apostasy _?_

The writing process was similar – lots of talking to myself, going on long walks and cold showers. Directing was more of a challenge on _Starve Acre_ because of all the additional elements. Shooting on location in a remote environment prone to hostile climatic conditions was hard enough… then throw in several animals, complicated puppetry, child actors, a covid outbreak that shut us down, and you’re getting close to what felt like our own little _Burden of Dreams_.

_Have you always been drawn to the horror genre? What were your influences in your approach to this film?_

I was a horror fan growing up, although that came with irritating religious guilt and often meant I would purge my VHS collection… Obviously as I got older and sensible enough not to throw out my film collection every few months, what frightened and provoked me started to change; absurd and surreal horror – horror that also worked as black comedy or had existential themes would continue to unsettle me.

A lot of old British gothic films had an influence over _Starve Acre_. Films like _Whistle and I’ll Come to You_. One recent discovery that really struck me was Nigel Kneale’s TV film _Murrain_ for its sparse, northern landscape, but also its tongue in cheek style. Also, when I was around 4 or 5 years old, I was subjected to Jan Svankmajer’s _Alice_ – which scared the living daylights out of me. The stop-motion taxidermy white rabbit was something I instantly thought back to when considering how to approach shooting the animal.

_What role does the English landscape play in the story you are seeking to tell here? Did you enjoy working with the period setting of the film?_

I love films from all periods, but I especially love what was happening in the 70s – the new Hollywood influence, the rough edge, the hairstyles. I rewatched _Scarecrow_ not long ago was drawn into its truthful acting and soft lighting – it felt raw but intimate unlike anything before the early 70s. I first saw _Texas Chainsaw Massacre_ during a rerun at showcase cinema in Manchester, and as a teen, I remember thinking that it felt so filthy that maybe the devil had spawned it. So I was initially excited about recreating this aesthetic and having a modern audience experience this same feeling. Then at the same time, I took pleasure in using the attitudes of the north of England in the 70s to tell a gothic tale. I peppered the script with little details that were typical of the time – e.g. attitudes towards mental health, the rise in domestic violence, the advances in social sciences etc. Plus there was something wry about this boomer generation couple and how they inadvertently unearthed a demon.

I think the British landscape is fundamental to the genre, for its nostalgic quality. In a way, the British landscape is representative of something we’ve left behind, along with our childish notions and superstitions, with the intention of never going back. Then of course, we get older, get priced out, or get homesick, and we start to consider moving back. _Starve Acre_ plays on these anxieties. What is waiting for you when you return to your roots? Which buried memories and superstitions will resurface to haunt you? Like Richard, you can try to tackle them in a modern, rational way, but there’s always an existential fear that something lies beneath the surface that you can’t control.

_What are the themes you wanted to explore through this film?_

I first saw this film as an ode to the hare and what it represents to us in myth and religion. The hare was sacred to Aphrodite, goddess of love, and Eros, the god of passion. And, the hare was a crucial part of the mythology of Eostre, or Ostara, the Saxon goddess of spring, that inspired our modern Easter. So it felt natural to use this symbol of love and rebirth, to tell a story of gothic romance. I’ve always found the way that love seems to overcome and pull people together despite all odds, as a strange, supernatural force in gothic stories. _Beauty and the Beast_, _Frankenstein_, most vampire stories, tend to critique the traditional concept of love. Rewatching Cocteau’s _La Belle et la Bête_ recently, I was struck by love’s power; it seems to grip Belle, like a demonic possession. In Cocteau’s hands, the fairytale tips over into the gothic. Love in his world is continually connected to dreams, madness, and poetry. This is something I’ve tried to infuse into the script while adapting _Starve Acre_. After all, the hare has often, throughout history, represented an incantation of love. And when would someone need that more than when they’re dealing with the tragedy of losing  
a child?
