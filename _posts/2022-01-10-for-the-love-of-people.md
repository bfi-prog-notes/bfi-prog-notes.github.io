Good evening. First, thank you for coming to this talk on the films of François Truffaut. I hope you will find it interesting. I am no expert on Truffaut, but I greatly enjoyed revisiting his work in order to research the BFI’s retrospective;  
I hope to share that enjoyment with you this evening, particularly through the clips I have selected, but also in passing on some thoughts I had after watching the films. For those of you who haven’t been to any of my previous talks, I should explain that my concern is with the films themselves, rather than with the biographical details of the man who made them, which I consider pertinent only insofar as they shaped his work. Moreover, what I have to say is certainly not offered up as any kind of definitive reading of some aspect or another of Truffaut’s creative achievements. Rather, the talk is simply my personal response to his body of work, and an expansion of the notes I  wrote about the films for the January and February editions of the BFI Southbank Guide.

In structuring the retrospective, I would happily have screened the films in the order they were made, but because colleagues suggested a thematic approach, I decided, as you have probably seen, to separate the films into four sections: those centred on the character of Antoine Doinel, those in which the influence of Jean Renoir might be discerned, those in which the influence of Alfred Hitchcock and American genre cinema might be discerned, and those films particularly notable as literary adaptations. We’ll be discussing those different aspects of Truffaut’s work this evening, but I should stress that the categories – and the way I divided up the films – are somewhat arbitrary.  The films I chose to exemplify ‘The Hitchcock Truffaut’, for example, are mostly adapted from books, so could have been filed under ‘The Literary Truffaut’ – except that the process of adaptation is not foregrounded as much in those films as it is in the titles I selected for ‘The Literary Truffaut’. In other words, the categories overlap; with the obvious exception of the Doinel films, where the films ended up being placed was a matter of nuance or emphasis.

One thing I learned from working my way through his films was that categorising Truffaut is never straightforward. For marketing purposes, a subtitle was provided for the retrospective – ‘For the Love of Films’ – to evoke not only Truffaut’s cinephilia but the centrality of film to his life and sense of identity; famously, he was a critic before becoming a filmmaker, and he himself felt that it was his passion for cinema – a passion he was encouraged to put to professional use by his friend and mentor André Bazin – that had saved him from becoming a delinquent. But I decided to use ‘For the Love of People…’ for the title of this evening’s talk because, notwithstanding his devotion to cinema, the films Truffaut made are not inspired by movies but about human individuals in all their messy complexity. Not only was Truffaut no Tarantino; he wasn’t even a Godard. It’s interesting to compare _Breathless_ with _Shoot the Pianist_, _Bande à Part_ with _Silken Skin_, _Made in USA_ with _The Bride Wore Black_. I offer those particular pairings, partly because of their approach to genre, partly because in each case the films were made in the same year – but how different they feel, not least in terms of characterisation and compassion.

Indeed, for all that Truffaut was probably the most audience-friendly of the five big names of the _nouvelle vague,_ he remains, perhaps, the hardest to pigeon-hole. Godard was for the most part concerned with interrogating cinematic conventions and the politics of cinematic representation. Rohmer established his own personal genre as a means of exploring the gaps between what is felt and thought, what is said and done. Chabrol used his own variations on Hitchcock’s tropes and themes to mount an ongoing critique of the French bourgeoisie, while Rivette created his own highly idiosyncratic, frequently fantastic and extended narrative experiments to ponder mysteries of community and creation. Truffaut, in comparison, is almost impossible to pin down. Restlessly ranging through different genres while seldom adhering to generic conventions, he nevertheless made films which feel unusually personal. That said, what would one expect from the man responsible for ‘_la politique des auteurs_’?

At a time when so much writing about movies involves hyperbolic five-star raves and dismissive put-downs, we surely need to take a nuanced approach to Truffaut’s work. Undoubtedly his body of work was uneven. Even individual films can be uneven. Some start weakly but end up considerably more satisfying than one initially expected. Though quite a few of his films are flawed to some degree, none of them is worthless or without interest. (Besides, perfection is impossible.) In revisiting Truffaut’s work, I found that many of the films surprised and stirred me with magically cinematic moments of subtle insight. I hope that you too will discover a few such moments this evening.
