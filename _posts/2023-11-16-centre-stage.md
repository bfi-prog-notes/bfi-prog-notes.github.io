Complex, memorable, subversive... and arguably on occasion also problematic, the female characters in Powell and Pressburger’s films are never less than fascinating. They were brought to vivid life by a number of great actors, many of whom became regular collaborators. Join our panel of special guests to explore their vital importance to the Archers’ films.
