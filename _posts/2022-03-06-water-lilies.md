**Céline Sciamma on ‘Water Lilies’**

Unfolding in an anonymous Parisian suburb over the course of a languid summer, Céline Sciamma’s debut _Water Lilies_ is a coming-of-age tale set within the world of synchronised swimming that captures the pleasure and pain as three 15-year-old girls explore their burgeoning sexuality.

Marie (Pauline Acquart) hopes to join her local synchronised swimming team, an ambition fuelled by her sexual attraction to popular captain Floriane (Adèle Haenel). Marie finds herself becoming an accomplice in a series of uncomfortable assignations with Floriane’s boyfriend François, while her best friend Anne (Louise Blachère) also has François in her sights. As friendships fray, Sciamma sets the stage for a series of power struggles.

Tender but with flashes of humour, the film explores emotional territory previously mined by Catherine Breillat and Lucrecia Martel, while the spirit of Esther Williams lingers in the distinctive underwater scenes. Bold, visually assured and knowingly kitsch, this is a promising and impressive debut.

_What is it about synchronised swimming that captured your attention?_

When I was 15 I attended a synchronised swimming exhibition and I thought I’d missed my vocation! Those girls were so accomplished, so feminine when I was still so childish in appearance, part of a team when I felt alone. This absurd memory struck me as a great example of the confusion you feel at that time of life, when you often mistake your desires. Plus I think that synchronised swimming says a lot about the female condition. Synchronised swimmers are soldiers who look like dolls: on the surface they have to pretend they don’t suffer, whereas underneath they struggle painfully. It reveals a lot about the job of being a girl.

_Was the depiction of how tough it is to be a girl one of your main aims?_

Even before I had the storyline I knew I wanted to depict what I call ‘the difficult job of being a girl’. Cinema has been talking about women for a century now but most of the talking has been done by men. I wanted to go against the undying male fascination for teenage girls in cotton underwear. _Water Lilies_ goes into girls’ locker rooms not to fantasise but to portray the reality.

_The film is especially impressive in its portrait of the awakening of Marie’s desires for Floriane._

I like to think of homosexuality not as a subject but as a journey. So I wanted to observe a very small moment: the awakening of desire and the journey of that desire from the moment it is born in the stomach until it travels to Marie’s consciousness. I wanted to capture the birth of desire rather than its affirmation, so _Water Lilies_ ends where most films on homosexual desire begin.

_Why did you avoid placing the film in a specific time?_

I wanted to portray universal feelings and sensations rather than doing a generational movie that would be an inside view of the teenagers of 2006 or look nostalgically at the past.

_Equally striking is the lack of an adult perspective._

I started writing scenes with the characters’ parents in them but I quickly found it boring. The complex relationship between teenagers and adults lies at the heart of the French tradition of teen movies from Truffaut’s _Les Quatre Cents Coups_ to Pialat’s _A nos amours_. But I decided I’d rather not talk about it at all and so I dispensed with it after the first draft. I also wanted everyone to identify with a 15-year-old girl and adult characters would have allowed them to find refuge elsewhere.
