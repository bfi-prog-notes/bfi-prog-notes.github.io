**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

The first voices to be heard in _Cries and Whispers_ are those of an army of clocks, muttering and chiming in a litany of comment at the uncontrollable passage of time. Surmounted by baroque helmets of golden cherubs, their faces stare at us in impassive accusation, as though confirming that to encase life in a mantelpiece ornament is one of mankind’s more ludicrous ways of externalising his mortality. There is a close-up of the second-hand, chopping down like a scythe, and then, in an instant of heart failure, a clock has stopped. It is as if a miraculous suspension of nature lets us slip through into an uncertain period beyond, where a woman sleeps, clumsy and inadvertent, in a chair, while another struggles through a crisis of agony on her sickbed, rises feebly, and sets the clock to rights again. She’ll last a little longer – long enough for us to explore whether her existence has been worth the struggle. ‘It’s early Monday morning,’ writes Agnes in her diary, a Brontë sister striving to come to terms with the intolerable, ‘and I’m in pain.’

It’s a superb opening, rich, elaborate, familiar. The images are fresh, yet _Wild_ _Strawberries_ (for example), with its eager coffin and uncommunicative timepieces, began in much the same way 15 years ago. Bergman has no right to expect us to join his game again, but one responds gratefully to the pattern as to an immaculate, freshly set-up chessboard, the symbols losing nothing in potency for their reappearance. Time always seems to have been running out for Bergman’s characters, deported as they are from a clouded past to a baleful future through the insubstantial landscape of the present. The journey allows them a few questions, some inarticulate gestures of love and hatred, and nothing more. They endure a lifetime of sleepless mornings, and an entire inquisition of doubts and pains.

For Agnes in _Cries and Whispers_ the pain is that of terminal cancer; she is dying among the blood-red furnishings of the family home, attended by her two sisters Karin and Maria, and by the devoted, motherly servant Anna. Despite its theatrical resonances, the situation assumes the usual Bergman complexity by the simplest of means – the flashback which we can believe or not as we please. Since the ambiguities of _Persona_ and _Hour of the Wolf_, Bergman’s sudden interpolations have not been the most precise means of following the narrative, but _Cries and Whispers_ appears to provide genuine, if startling, recollections, heralded and concluded by floods of crimson across the screen.

Agnes (Harriet Andersson), who has never married, has passed the years in memory of the mother who largely ignored her except for a single sorrowful gaze. The others have suffered more eventfully. Maria (Liv Ullmann) has had an affair with the local doctor, leading her despairing husband to attempt suicide, while Karin (Ingrid Thulin) is imprisoned in marriage with a man she loathes so much that on one occasion she mutilated herself to avoid his clutches in the bedroom. These two operatic sequences – Maria’s husband staggering about with a paper-knife in his chest and Karin hacking between her legs with a piece of glass and smearing the blood across her mouth – are punctuated by the hideous spasms of Agnes as she dies. Take it all seriously? Well, no. But the melodrama has prepared the way for the film’s most extraordinary sequence, in which Anna the maid dreams, imagines, or remembers (it’s not too important which) the resurrection of Agnes and the cries of her shrouded body for the embraces of her sisters. Their disgust and terror outweigh their affection for Agnes, and it is left to Anna to provide for any physical comforts that the living corpse may need.

Bergman’s final images are tranquil, a symphony of white dresses and late summer colours; it is a day recorded by Agnes’ diary as her happiest, spent in the company of her devoted sisters. Like Björnstrand’s speech at the end of _Through a Glass Darkly_, it needs to be treated with suspicion, not least for the sentimentality with which Bergman infuses it. The joyful Agnes, whose feet never were too firmly on the ground, depended for her perfect day on the façade presented by the impulsive Maria and the unresponsive Karin, whose incompatibility (however much exaggerated by Anna’s fantasy) has been illustrated by their parting conversation. Betrayal is more in their nature than love. So Agnes may be able to conquer pain with love, but it leaves her no better off than the rest of them – even the maid is a mother substitute and treats Agnes as a replacement for the child she lost. Yet Bergman’s clocks keep ticking; since the duration of our lives is so brief, he seems to say, why not settle for an illusion or two? It’s an unusually mellow conclusion, and he’ll need to reach it several times in a row before we can believe he means it.

In all other respects, _Cries and Whispers_ is a well-thumbed catalogue of disillusionments. As in _Hour of the Wolf_, Bergman has assembled characters from all stages of his previous work – the scornful lover from _Sawdust and Tinsel_, the tortured cleric from _Winter Light_, the rapacious sensualist and the brooding intellectual from _The_ _Silence_, the below-stairs realist from _Smiles of a Summer Night_. All the old conclusions are there: marriage is a tissue of lies, men are weak, brutal and repulsive, sex is degrading, faith is inaccessible unless you have it already, in which case it’s inexplicable. At times, _Cries and Whispers_ looks like self-plagiarism, particularly when Anders Ek, voice atremble, tells us straight to camera that Agnes had a stronger faith than his, or when Erland Josephson and Liv Ullmann take each other’s wrinkles to task in close-up. Occasionally there’s even a narrator, chipping in abruptly to tide us over a bit of explanation the easy way, his contributions too arbitrary to appear much more than second thoughts. ‘It’s the same old film every time,’ Bergman said while shooting it, ‘the same actors, the same scenes, the same problems. The only thing that makes it different is that we’re older…’

Nevertheless, the other differences are there. For a start, _Cries and Whispers_ is a stunning Bergman experiment in the uses of red and white, its rooms upholstered with membranous scarlet, its occupants like brilliantly costumed ghosts. The elemental colours give a magnificent force to the anguish of the characters; if nothing else, they look too good to be disregarded. And striking in on them from the delicious, neglected world outside, like brief illuminations of their dark lives, come geometric slabs of sunlight, warming a face here, a smile there, until the breakthrough comes at last with the final open-air exuberance. Bergman and Nykvist have been achieving miracles with light for years, but _Cries and Whispers_ is unquestionably their greatest collaboration.
