Over here to publicise her latest film, _“What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?”_, Bette Davis has about as much physical resemblance to the character she plays in it as her 19-year-old Stanley in _In This Our Life_ (1942) had to her Queen Elizabeth of three years earlier. The voice, the hair, are still very Margo Channing. The figure is slim. Where Joan Crawford has generally equated playing for real with a marked absence of make-up (_Baby Jane_, _Paid_, the splendidly schizoid finale of _Possessed_), Bette Davis has often preferred to pile it on. Wearing Jane’s horrendous mask, which tops the last ravaged stages of Mrs Skeffington’s decline with Mary Pickford ringlets and a velvet pancake hat, was apparently a great strain. ‘We shot the exteriors on location using passers-by, not extras, in the streets. I’d dive out of the bank to my car, and a startled voice would say: “What the hell was _that_!”’

She agrees that there is a lot of Stanley in Jane: the same psychopathic pattern of the ruthlessly selfish and destructive child who has never grown up, the same wheedling helplessness when things get out of hand. But Jane, for all her malignity, she sees as an essentially sympathetic, tragic character, whereas the unilluminated hardness Huston insisted she bring to Stanley she found uncongenial. In common with other actresses (Nancy Price, Flora Robson) best remembered for their ‘bad’ characters, Bette Davis has no interest in uncompromisingly evil roles. This doubtless partly accounts for her loathing of _Beyond the Forest_ and the tensions with Wyler (‘If I was a Callas, he was the male Bette Davis’) which surfaced during _The Letter_ and flared up decisively on _The Little Foxes_. Nevertheless she regards Wyler as her most rewarding director and mentor, the one she would most like to work with again.

‘Bob Aldrich is a genius.’ This wasn’t a comment on the finished film – she hadn’t apparently seen it yet – but on his decision to co-star her with Joan Crawford, and on the way he finished the job within five weeks. ‘Joan, the great glamour star, and me, I’ve no glamour, I’m an actress.’ She didn’t have time, during such a frantic shooting schedule, even to begin to wonder whether the film would be a success. Now she marvels at the way teenagers are flocking to see a picture which, she reminds me, ‘has no sex’.

Certainly, short of a comeback by Garbo, it is difficult to imagine a more commanding star occasion. Davis and Crawford, Red Queen and White Queen, together for the first time in roles they might have dreamed up themselves. No other distaff casting, however different or distinguished the film, could produce quite the same frisson of anticipation. Stanwyck and Katharine Hepburn, Dietrich and Vivien Leigh: however auspicious the project one doubts whether any such partnership could be regarded as a factor vital to success. Only Davis and Crawford, though separately minor box-office draws for some years now, together amount to a potently unique commodity, a film’s sole _raison d’être_.

That _Baby Jane_ should have been conceived as a blatantly opportunistic vehicle is not, in itself, especially culpable. At least it _is_ a vehicle. It goes. It is the half-heartedness of its propulsion that one regrets. Agreed that a warning example of box-office mutability was recently supplied by the comparative flop of Judy Garland’s _I Could Go On Singing_. But whereas musicals have always proved notoriously fallible, Associates and Aldrich could surely have assumed that _Baby Jane_ would tap contemporary appetites at their safest and sickest: post-_Psycho_ horrors, a decaying _Sunset Boulevard_ setting, sadism both explicit and – in the cross-cutting from stewed rat or smashed skull to equally brutal comic relief – implicit.

Yet, apart from the stars, there is little sign of confidence on the screen.  
The production, which amassed a total of $2,000,000 in rental fees within a fortnight of its American release opening, cost a tight $825,000. Davis and Crawford refused to sell out their handsome stake in the profits; and in view of the picture’s frequent air of incompetence one can only applaud their foresight.

One factor remains, however, and it is greatly to Aldrich’s credit. Unlike certain directors who have deferred too readily to these actresses’ demands, he has frequently caught them here at their best, never at their worst. (One recalls, if reluctantly, Bette Davis’s jodhpurred Napoleonic tantrums in Irving Rapper’s _Another Man’s Poison_, or Joan’s first flouncing entrance down about six flights of stairs in Ranald McDougall’s _Queen Bee_.) There are times when Aldrich’s disinclination to cut away from his stars leaves them high and dry, as if they were waiting for a new page of script to be delivered. But in the main they seem to have found a new maturity, a discipline encouraged perhaps by the confined sets and Crawford’s wheelchair, or by the interaction of their professional rivalry upon a belated mutual respect.

Gone is Crawford’s galvanic facial display. In its place is the fine muscular tension of her agonised drag down the stairs, followed by some notable close-ups of pouched, terrified eyes and sagging chin at the phone; and all along that sense of silky reasonableness hiding inner steel, paving the way for the unconvincing yet histrionically memorable last-minute confession.

This scene, weirdly touching in its regression to sandcastles, ice-creams, childhood secrets and reconciliations, provides one of Bette’s most characteristic reaction-shots: hands clapped defiantly over her ears, then unwillingly removed, truth dawning, body and face tautening, eyes dilated in horror, the slow turn of the head, and finally a girlish scramble to her feet and simple; spontaneous forgiveness. Showy though the part is, she still resists the temptation to caricature its obvious Charles Addams qualities. Caught dumping a corpse in the back of her car, she represses her terror under a chill, weary, sullen air of resignation. The observation here is controlled, intelligent, absolutely right. Just as sure is the acid comedy of her impersonation of Joan Crawford on the telephone, or her abstracted exchanges with the equally self-absorbed pianist to whom she confides her grotesque plans for a Las Vegas come-back.

I can’t entirely agree with those critics who maintain that _Baby Jane_ is disagreeable because it ‘plays on the public’s subconscious resentment of film stars.’ It seems to me that a better case could be made out along these lines against producers. One thing the recent autobiographies of Davis and Crawford have in common is this suggestion of a reckless, almost insanely destructive resentment on the part of some Hollywood executives towards the stars they have helped to create. Sacked if they have ‘about as much sex appeal as Slim Summerville’ (Carl Laemmle on Davis); rewarded, if they have a personal success, with a load of junk gathering the dust of years on a script editor’s shelf; reminded continually, in case they get too uppity, that a star has only four years at the top – that celebrated old MGM litany of the Thirties.  
The careers of both actresses are a story of constant battles for better directors and a continuity of suitable scripts. The cost, in Miss Davis’s own words, has been a (deserved) reputation for being ‘uncompromising, peppery, intractable, monomaniacal, tactless, volatile and oft-times disagreeable.’
