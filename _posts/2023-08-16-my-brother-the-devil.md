**Sally El Hosaini on ‘My Brother the Devil’**

Occasionally festival juries get it right. The award for Best British Newcomer at [the 2011] BFI London Film Festival went to writer-director Sally El Hosaini for _My Brother the Devil_, one of the most visually striking British debuts in recent times. It tells of two brothers of Egyptian descent growing up on a Hackney council estate. Elder brother Rashid (James Floyd) is mired in drug-dealing and local gang culture, but determined that younger brother Mo (Fady Elsayed) shouldn’t follow suit, preferring him to focus on educational achievement as a way out. Mo has different ideas, of course, and further twists in the tale will place their patiently evoked fraternal bond under pressure.

I probably don’t need to remind you of the numerous British horrors mining similar urban territory. Apart from skirting clichés, what El Hosaini brings to the table is a profound understanding of the dislocations often attendant on a mixed cultural heritage (she herself is half Egyptian); a concern for authenticity (particularly East London street argot) which doesn’t fetishise or glamorise; a brilliantly chosen and directed cast of mainly non-professionals; and a sensitive ﬁguring of turbulent interior lives through superb camera and sound work. It all adds up to a heartfelt film that lives and breathes.

_What was the starting point for_ My Brother the Devil_?_

I’d lived in Hackney for over ten years, on the same council estate, and I’d seen a lot of change over that time. I wanted to do a film about two brothers, and because it looked like it was going to be micro micro micro-budget I thought, ‘Well, I’ll just set it on my council estate.’ In the wake of the London bombings there was a lot of stuff in the press about Arabs and Muslims and a certain kind of image projected, and I thought, ‘I really want to do the film that’s not the terrorist film – that’s a bit playful, that’s actually showing the real things these kids are dealing with.’

_The older brother Rashid is played by an actor, James Floyd, but the others are mainly non-professionals._

I met so many fascinating boys during my research and thought, ‘Wow, they can really act. They could do better than an actor.’ But I was really worried about casting an actor among non-actors. I wasn’t able to find a real boy who was prepared to do the Rashid role. James really impressed me with the amount of hard work he put in just for the audition – it was miles more than anyone else had done. And I realised I needed someone who was going to be Method, and who was going to go and get to know the real guys. All I said to him was: ‘Don’t get arrested.’

_What were you looking for when you chose your cinematographer?_

With David [Raedeker] what I noticed was he allowed his camerawork to get messy for the performance. And I had seen other extremely talented cinematographers, but their work was so stunning that it was inaccessible. You almost didn’t care about the characters because it was just too good. I really felt that [Raedeker] was someone who was going to allow space for the actors to blossom. When you’re working with non-actors and young actors, it requires someone who’s going to be much more spontaneous – in the moment and responding, not coming at it with a very dogmatic ‘This is the shot’ or ‘This light has moved two inches because an actor kicked it.’ I needed that more flexible way.

_What else were you looking to achieve visually in the film?_

Our main rule was that the shooting style would be subjective, so whenever we composed shots of the brothers we would always be thinking about the experience of that moment through the five senses. The other big decision that affected the aesthetic was to shoot in Scope. When I was shopping the script around trying to raise money, something a lot of people said to me was, ‘Oh, it’s set on a Hackney council estate. OK, we know what that film is.’ Well actually, no. Because have you been to Hackney? Have you been on a council estate? There’s actually grass – they’re not that bad; there’s sky, there’s ﬂowers, there’s trees. What I realised was that there was this whole thing of outsiders making films looking in, and I thought if there’s one aspiration I have, it’s for this film to be from the inside looking out. That matched up with our ambition to be very subjective. So we realised that we should make this film an adventure rather than mundane, and Scope made it that – because you’re suddenly applying a different way of looking at a world that we’re used to seeing on TV screens.

_It lifts your film into another dimension._

And also it allowed us to be very intimate, because you’re forced into all these close-ups with Scope. And the actors had better be completely honest, because they’re going to show up if they’re not.

_Your own background clearly informs your depiction of the brothers and  
their family._

In a way Rashid has become the dad that his father can’t be, because the parents are so out of touch – because they literally come from another world. They don’t actually understand the world their sons inhabit. Their sons are living this split because there’s them outside, navigating the world, and there’s them at home. A lot of Arab people living in the West will identify with that  
split personality.
