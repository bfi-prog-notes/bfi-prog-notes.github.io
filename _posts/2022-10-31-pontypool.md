As a conceit for a penny-pinching horror movie, it’s hard to fault. Restrict the action to the basement studio of a local radio station in deepest Ontario and feel the tension rise as reports come in of inexplicable incidents, marauding residents and blood on the streets. Are the broadcasters and their listeners the victims of some elaborate stunt, or could this really be happening? Initially, at least, there’s no corroboration on the wire services, but when the BBC starts asking about an apparent ‘insurgency’ gripping the area, it’s clear that this is no ordinary day of weather reports and eye-in-the-sky travel updates for Stephen McHattie’s gravel-voiced shock jock Grant Mazzy.

Adapted from Tony Burgess’ novel _Pontypool Changes Everything_, Canadian indie stalwart Bruce McDonald’s latest has another trick in store, which raises it from the familiarity of mere zombie siege suspenser to something else, since the claustrophobic unease also provokes the notion of a viral infection of the global media babblesphere, suggesting that the unstoppable flow of information overload isn’t just perverting language but potentially rotting our brains. So it’s one for fans of George Romero and William Burroughs (whose writings, of course, put forward the notion of language as a viral entity), as the film’s exposition fills in how the mother tongue is passing on the flesh-craving contagion, and it thus dawns on Mazzy that every word to pass his lips is escalating the outbreak. In between, there’s a moment to have literary theory students levitating with excitement as Mazzy makes a heroic attempt to save the day with a monologue (‘Kill is kiss… kiss is kill!’ etc) setting out to defamiliarise language by detaching listening from understanding. In other hands, this might come across as insufferably pretentious, but it’s a tribute to McHattie’s spot-on contribution that it sings with a kind of desperate rebel defiance in the face of the inevitable, absurd yet also strangely captivating.  
It’s a welcome showcase too for an actor whose evident talents have arguably never quite achieved the career profile they deserve.

It’s refreshing to see a filmmaker keeping faith with the idea of the low-budget horror arena as a breeding ground for radical ideas. And, of course, the particular nuance that it’s only English that’s affected, not French, must certainly have prompted some rueful chuckles from the Québécois.

There are, frankly, only so many zombie films that world needs and the prospect of another rarely elicits much enthusiasm these days. But there are occasional gems to be found in the now well-worn walking dead sub-genre and Bruce McDonald’s remarkable Canadian low budgeter _Pontypool_ finds something fresh and innovative to do with a fetid sub-genre that was all but played out by the end of the first decade of the 21st century. Based on the novel _Pontypool Changes Everything_ by Tony Burgess (who also penned this adaptation) it sidesteps the clichés of the zombie movie by virtually ignoring the George A. Romero model in favour of something far more interesting.

Set almost entirely in a single room, _Pontypool_ charts a zombie holocaust with a difference as radio DJ Grant Mazzy (Stephen McHattie) and his team, Sydney Briar (Lisa Houle) and Laurel Ann (Georgina Reilly), gradually piece together the jigsaw of clues painting a disturbing vision of the world beyond their basement studio falling apart. As the local population go on a killing spree it slowly dawns on them that a virus is being spread through the English language, key words (particularly terms of endearment) triggering a murderous psychosis in those who can understand them.

Set in the suburbs of Ontario, where French is spoken alongside English, _Pontypool_ is a uniquely Canadian film. When it becomes clear that somehow the plague is being spread by a comprehension of English words (the film is purposefully vague about the mechanics of the infection) Mazzy and Briar (Laurel Ann has already succumbed and joined the ranks of the ‘conversationalists’) try to limit communication to French, though Mazzy in particular isn’t much of a linguist. A cure of sorts is effected when the couple discover that repeating English trigger words repeatedly until they obliterate any sense of meaning (‘Kiss is kill’).

Freed of the need to deliver the now _de rigueur_ gore, _Pontypool_ ploughs its own intellectual furrow, channelling David Cronenberg more than Romero. It questions the effectiveness of the authorities to deal with a situation this bizarre (a warning broadcast in French ends with the useless and ill-placed advice not to translate the message), the role of the media in times of catastrophe (Mazzy tries to do his best to keep the locals informed but is thrown off-balance by an idiot BBC reporter who phones in looking for an interview, determined that the mayhem is being caused by Québécois separatists) and the fallibility of human communication. All heady stuff that gives _Pontypool_ a distinct edge against the hordes of identikit direct-to-DVD zombie effluence released each year.

McDonald mostly keeps the visceral stuff off screen (though an increasingly bloody Laurel Ann’s relentless attempts to get at her colleagues by throwing herself against the plexiglass soundproofing has a nasty payoff), preferring to engage the imagination and intellect rather than the gut. The real horror in _Pontypool_ comes from the knowledge that the uninfected will eventually, by necessity, have to either live completely isolated lives, never speaking to anyone in their native tongue again, nor ever watching native-language films or TV or listening to the radio, or find a completely new language to communicate with, or succumb to the infection. And if English is susceptible to this kind of contamination, how safe is any other tongue going to be?

Performances are first rate throughout, though the show is comprehensively stolen by McHattie, rarely given this much to do and making a grand job of a past his prime cynic given a late-in-life chance to shine in extraordinary circumstances. He’s well matched by Houle (McHattie’s real-life wife) and Reilly, the three of them carrying much of the film with only minimal support from the obligatory doctor who knows too much (Hrant Alianak), a few shambling ‘conversationalists’ (the word zombie is never used), voices heard in phone-ins or live reports or a visiting theatre group who are plugging their musical version of _Lawrence of Arabia_.

Wildly imaginative, _Pontypool_ is quite unlike not only any other zombie film but pretty much any other horror movie. Its dizzying mix of linguistic theory, apocalyptic horror and small-scale drama is exhilarating and renews one faith in a horror seam that had looked well and truly mined to exhaustion.
