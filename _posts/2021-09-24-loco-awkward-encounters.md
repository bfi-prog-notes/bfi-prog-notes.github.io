BAFTA-recognised festival LOCO aka The London Comedy Film Festival is back to share the best comedy short films rescued from the madness of 2020 in this Comedy Shorts Weekender, in partnership with MindsEye.

Where would comedy be without those embarrassing and difficult moments in life? Sit back and enjoy 90 minutes of other people’s confusion, conflict and chaos. Amongst the toe-curling tales of awkwardness are a call centre inquisition, a creative dispute, some dodgy counselling and a visit to a rather dysfunctional book club.
