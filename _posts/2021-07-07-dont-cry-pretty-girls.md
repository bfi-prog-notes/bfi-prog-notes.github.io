Music drives this loose narrative of youth culture with a romance at its heart. Searching for their identity, a group of friends explore new ways to live, seeking independence from state and patriarchal family values. What happens when a young woman refuses to be defined by these? A strong sense of female agency drives the camera’s point of view and our gaze.<br>

_Don’t Cry, Pretty Girls!_ is itself contemporary with the realities of international youth culture and rebellion against the parental world. The oppositional culture of rock music is given its due as a harbinger of social dissatisfaction; Mészáros’ masterful use of lyrics and melody itself constitutes the contestatory statement she clearly intends to make.<br>

The film analyses the gradually loosening social structures in the Beat age within the framework of Mészáros’ concerns – women’s desire for freedom – while the biggest 1960s Beat bands play in the background. The film is an accurate testimony of the partying/depressive atmosphere pervading Europe in the wake of the suppression of the various 1968 popular movements.

**Márta Mészáros** occupies a unique position in Hungarian and world film history. The director, Kossuth and Prima Prize laureate, winner of awards at Berlinale, Chicago, Cannes and many other international film festivals, is herself a legend. Together with her contemporaries Agnès Varda, Larisa Shepitko and Věra Chytilová, she ranks as one of the most significant female filmmakers in the world. The first Hungarian woman to be awarded a diploma in film directing, her movies depict the lives of women, their identity, deviance, female rebelliousness, erotic intimacy as well as Hungarian Stalinism.

Even as a young orphan child she struggled with hunger and the vicissitudes of history. She was born in Budapest in 1931. Her father, the avant-garde sculptor László Mészáros, in fleeing fascism moved the family to Kirgizia, where on the outbreak of World War II he fell victim to Stalin’s purges. Her mother also died. She was placed in a Soviet orphanage and only returned to Hungary after the war. Between 1954 and 1956 she studied at the film academy in Moscow and until 1968 she made Romanian and Hungarian documentaries. These autobiographical motifs inspired her _Diary_ series, which met considerable international acclaim.

In 1968, she directed her first full-length film _The Girl_. With her following works _Don’t Cry, Pretty Girls!_, _Riddance_, _Adoption_, _Nine Months_ and _The Two of Them_, Márta Mészáros depicts – in a non-judgemental and unaffected way –  the process where something great and simple happens in the lives and relationships of her self-aware, rebellious female protagonists, forcing them to make decisions.

These films were instant international hits. In 1975, Márta Mészáros won a Golden Bear at the Berlinale for _Adoption_, being awarded to a female director and also Hungarian director for the very first time in the history of the Berlinale. _Nine Months_ took an OCIC prize at the Berlinale and a FIPRESCI prize at Cannes in 1977 and this opened the way to international co-productions.

_The Heiresses_, made in a coproduction, reveals a historical background behind remarkable love triangle relationships. Then came the _Diary_ tetralogy, of which the first, _Diary for My Children_, won the Grand Prix Speciale du Jury at Cannes in 1984.

In 2004 Mészáros directed _Unburied Man_, a film about Imre Nagy, the leading figure of the 1956 Hungarian Revolution. Her latest work, _Aurora Borealis_ (2017), which has been awarded with several international awards, looks back to the Soviet occupation of Vienna through an unusual mother-daughter fate.<br>
