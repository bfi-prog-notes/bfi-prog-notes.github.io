Perception is of course subjective, but the collective viewing experience can conjure a magic all of its own. Images swirl and distort in our memories, and films we’ve seen can swim to the surface years later. The films in this programme subvert the visual medium, playing tricks on the viewer and manipulating images from decades ago using AI. Analogue cinema is alive and well in the townships of Tanzania thanks to a community of dedicated cinephiles, and reality becomes slippery in the primeval Finnish forest, making us question the veracity of documentary filmmaking.

Rachel MacLean (_Make Me Up_) returns to LSFF with her latest mind-bending work _Duck_, reanimating screen icons to disturbing and alluring effect. The decades-old mystery of missing British adult film actress Kathy Harcourt is reinvestigated in _Flyby Kathy_.
