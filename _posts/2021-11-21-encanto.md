_+ Q&A with director Jared Bush, co-director Charise Castro Smith, producer Clark Spencer and actor Stephane Beatriz._

**What’s it about?**  
The Madrigal family live in an enchanted village in the mountains of Colombia. Every child but one in their magical house has been granted a unique ability such as strength or healing powers. Mirabel, the only ordinary Madrigal, discovers that the magic is under threat and she may be the only one able to save it. Directed by the team behind Zootropolis and with songs by Lin-Manuel Miranda, this animated musical fantasy is going to be magical.

**‘Even in our darkest moments, there’s light where you least expect it.’**  
Before the setting was chosen, before even a single character was imagined, the filmmakers behind Walt Disney Animation Studios’ all-new original feature film _Encanto_ had decided what the heart of their new film would be: family. _Encanto_ explores the compelling but complicated relationships within families. ‘We thought it would be amazing to tell a story about not just a pair of characters but a large extended family,’ says director Byron Howard (Oscar®-winning director of _Zootopia_, _Tangled_). ‘We wanted to celebrate and try to understand how the complex dynamics in big families really work. How well do we know our families? How well do they know us?’

Adds director and screenwriter Jared Bush (co-director/co-writer _Zootopia_, writer _Moana_), ‘It’s a story about how the people who are closest to us, especially family members, don’t always see us – or fully understand us. And likewise, we don’t show people we love our whole selves for many reasons. Our story shows how one member of a family who feels the least seen can learn to see her whole family and ultimately herself.’

_Encanto_ tells the tale of an extraordinary family, the Madrigals, who live hidden in the mountains of Colombia, in a magical house, in a vibrant town, in a wondrous, charmed place called an _Encanto_. The magic of the _Encanto_ has blessed every child in the family with a unique gift from super strength to the power to heal – every child except one, Mirabel. But when she discovers that the magic surrounding the _Encanto_ is in danger, Mirabel decides that she, the only ordinary Madrigal, might just be her exceptional family’s last hope.
