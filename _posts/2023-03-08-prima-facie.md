This exclusive screening of Suzie Miller’s award-winning play is presented as part of 2023’s **WOW Festival** in London, which takes place 10-12 March at Southbank Centre and brings together incredible speakers, performers and more for three days of unmissable events and activism. Find out more below.

Starring Jodie Comer (_Killing Eve_) in her astonishing West End debut, _Prima Facie_ tells the story of Tessa, a young, brilliant barrister. She has worked her way up from working class origins to be at the top of her game; defending; cross-examining and winning.  An unexpected event forces her to confront the lines where the patriarchal power of the law, burden of proof and morals diverge.

_Prima Facie_ takes us to the heart of where emotion and experience collide with the rules of the game.

Justin Martin directs this solo tour de force, captured live from the intimate Harold Pinter Theatre in London’s West End. After sold out runs in cinemas across the UK, _Prima Facie_ is back on the big screen for one night only as part of the WOW – Women of the  World Festival.

**Post screening discussion**  
The screening will be followed by a panel discussion led by WOW Founder **Jude Kelly**, with **Helena Kennedy KC**, **Kate Parker** and **Danielle Manson**, who’ll give their perspectives on the play.

**Helena Kennedy** has been at the Bar for 50 years and is one of Britain’s most distinguished lawyers, spending her professional life giving voice to those who have least power within the system. **Kate Parker** is the founder of the Schools Consent Project, the official fundraising partner of _Prima Facie_ during its West End and Broadway run, and **Danielle Manson** assisted the creative team with their research for the play, including facilitating the time they spent at the Old Bailey. She has since launched a project aimed at exploring whether (now in its 20th year) the Sexual Offences Act 2003 deals appropriately with issues of consent and reasonable belief in consent.
