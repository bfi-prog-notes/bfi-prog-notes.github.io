In 1950, Emeric Pressburger read an extract from ‘Ill Met by Moonlight’, Stanley Moss’s account of his adventures on occupied Crete during the Second World War, and immediately optioned its film rights. Michael Powell set off on a location scouting expedition to Crete, but it was another six years before _Ill Met by Moonlight_ finally went into production. After leaving the Rank Organisation in 1949, Powell and Pressburger had briefly returned to producer Alexander Korda to make films such as _The Small Back Room_ (1949) and _Gone to Earth_ (1950). They then encountered a period of difficulty in securing financing for the projects they wanted to make, and by the mid-1950s were willing to contemplate a return, albeit a short-term one, to John Davis and the Rank Organisation. _The Battle of the River Plate_ (1956) was a commercial success and chosen for the Royal Command Performance of that year (an honour that had been bestowed upon _A Matter of Life and Death_ back in 1946). Davis then offered the Archers a seven-picture contract, but wary of committing themselves, they signed for just one picture – _Ill Met by Moonlight_.

By 1956, the political situation in Crete had made location shooting unviable and _Ill Met_ was instead filmed in the hills behind Powell’s family hotel in the south of France. However, the poetic use of landscape that characterises earlier Archers’ films such as _A Canterbury Tale_ (1944) and _‘I Know Where I’m Going!’_ (1945) is evident in the atmospheric shots of the mountainous countryside, beautifully photographed in black and white by Christopher Challis, while Mikis Theodorakis’ rousing score conveys something of the richness of Greek culture, the patriotism and bravery of its people and the rugged beauty of the Cretan landscape.

Michael Powell took mischievous delight in tormenting Davis with requests for actors such as Orson Welles and James Mason to play lead roles, but Dirk Bogarde, one of Rank’s contracted stars, was eventually chosen to play Patrick Leigh Fermor. His portrayal is flamboyant, charming and charismatic, although Powell later grumbled, ‘I wanted a flamboyant young murderer, lover, bandit... and instead I got a picture-postcard hero in fancy dress.’ Archers regulars Marius Goring and Cyril Cusack, as the malignant General and the unwashed Captain, turn in strong performances that rather obscure David Oxley’s adequate but anaemic portrayal of author Stanley Moss.
