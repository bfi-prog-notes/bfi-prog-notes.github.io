Our regular Philosophical Screens series, which explores cinema through a philosophical lens, returns this month with a focus on one of the most genre-bending films about noodles. Join our regular film philosophers Lucy Bolton and Catherine Wheatley, as well as guest speaker Victor Fan of King’s College London, to consider the film’s themes of pleasure, self-perfection and tradition.<br>
