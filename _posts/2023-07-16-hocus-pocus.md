Young Max and his family move to Salem. On Halloween night, he inadvertently brings back to life a trio of malevolent sibling witches who, in order to live forever, have to carry out a heinous act. However, they only have 24 hours to do it and soon realise their task isn’t going to be quite so easy. Cue a race against time involving all manner of magical mayhem. Although it struggled on first release, _Hocus Pocus_ now has a global cult following and continues to delight.

The beginnings of _Hocus Pocus_ lay in a (non-talking) cat. One night producer David Kirschner and his young daughter were sitting outside their home watching the local activity when Sam, a neighbour’s black cat, strayed by. Kirschner began at once to make up a story of how Sam was once a boy. His daughter then wanted to know how what had happened. ‘I contrived a legend which said that 300 years ago a young boy was trying to protect his little sister from three witches who then cast a hex on him.’ From that father-daughter chat, and from that cat (renamed Binx) sprang the entire film.

In keeping with Kirschner’s conception of the story as a legend, great attention was paid to the ‘look’ of everything. Designer William Sandell’s team created a cemetery with careful attention to topography, trees and rocks; then spent months researching houses until they came up with a perfect design for the witches’ house. ‘We looked at a number of restored and preserved houses in Salem; and we examined many books and illustrations. However, the architecture was always too simple and stark for our purposes. None of it was like the ‘Hansel and Gretel’ witch type of motif we wanted. As a result, our house ended up being an amalgam of everybody’s vision of a witch’s house – from fairy tales to Mother Goose. Even so, it was a real house. All the beams are real, and fixed in the correct fashion. You could have placed it on a hill somewhere, and really lived in it.’

As well as this kind of reality, there is also plenty of Halloween magic – so much that the filmmakers had to employ every possible type of visual effect available at the time. There are traditional effects, such as matte paintings; and there are more recent effects, such as the use of Blue Screen to capture the Sandersons’ flying skills.

‘We also had to create Binx somehow’, commented executive producer Ralph Winter, ‘since he is at the heart of the story. To do that we found a computer graphic technology which had not been used significantly before. A real cat’s image was put into the computer, and there we removed the head and replaced it by a completely synthetic, anatomically correct, three-dimensional articulated head. So in each Binx scene there’s a real body under a computer-generated head. When we were finished, Binx definitely looked as if he was talking.’

And to make friends with Binx, the story called for three children. Director Ortega described the casting process: ‘Thora Birch was one of the top five children in her age group. She is a very dynamic little girl, and we knew at once she was our Dani. Then we had to find her a brother. We needed someone strong enough to hold the screen with her. We saw over 600 boys. We actually rejected Omri Katz at an early stage – he was sick during his first audition and had no sparkle. But he recovered and came back and this time we were sure he was right for the role of Max. Vinessa likewise was a choice made after many hours of auditions.’

For adult star Bette Midler all the work was worth it, because ‘There’s usually nothing for my six-year-old to see, but this is broad and silly, the violence is minimal, and I don’t have to worry about what I look like.’
