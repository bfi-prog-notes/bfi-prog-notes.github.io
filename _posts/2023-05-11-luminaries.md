_+ intro and Q&A with Dishoom co-founder Shamil Thakrar, director  Sanvir Singh, history teacher Shalina Patel and film producer Ramneet Baidwan, moderated by Ashvin Devasundaram (Senior Lecturer, World Cinema, Queen Mary University)._

The untold story of Indian independence is seen through the décor of the Dishoom restaurant in Kings Cross, formerly a railway transit shed built in 1850. Dishoom co-founder Shamil Thakrar and history teacher Shalina Patel wander through the space after hours, discussing key figures and events, while the film illustrates this narration with a mixture of live action and animation.
