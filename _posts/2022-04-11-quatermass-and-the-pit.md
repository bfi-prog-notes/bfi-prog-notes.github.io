The third series – and perhaps the best – featuring Nigel Kneale’s hugely successful creation, the steadfast scientific genius Professor Bernard Quatermass, _Quatermass and the Pit_ (BBC) was also the last, until the character was resurrected for one final appearance in _Quatermass_ (ITV, 1979). Running over six Monday evenings between December 1958 and January 1959, the series, like its predecessors, was compulsory viewing.

The professor was played this time by André Morell, the third actor to take the role. Morell, who had previously appeared as O’Brien in Kneale’s adaptation of George Orwell’s _Nineteen Eighty-Four_ (BBC, tx. 12.12.1954), typically played clipped-voiced officer types – as he did in David Lean’s _The Bridge Over the River Kwai_ (1957) –, and he brought a natural authority to the part.

As in the previous stories, Quatermass was pitted against an extra-terrestrial threat – in this case an ancient and hostile intelligence from Mars – in an exciting and intelligent story which mined mythology and folklore and carried serious political and philosophical ideas. The story begins with the discovery by workmen of a curious skull. Further digging uncovers what appears to be an unexploded bomb – not an uncommon find more than a decade after the war. The professor gets involved when it becomes clear that the skull represents a previously unknown human relative, and that the ‘bomb’ is in fact an alien vessel.

Although the special effects may appear crude now, the series remains powerful today thanks to an exciting climax and some genuinely thought-provoking ideas. Like many of Kneale’s later works, notably _The Stone Tape_ (BBC, tx. 25.12.1972), _Quatermass and the Pit_ puts a scientific spin on the supernatural tale, in this case suggesting that mankind was visited in its distant past by an evil alien force, which left its mark in our own vicious nature and inspired our ancestors’ depictions of demons and devils.

Another interesting feature of the series is the way in which Kneale uses his creation to attack the military and government’s subordination of science to their own ends. The story begins with the professor furious after his rocket project is placed under military control, while one of the more satisfying moments comes when Colonel Breen (Anthony Bushell), Quatermass’s arrogant and narrow-minded rival, meets an untimely end.<br>

**‘Quatermass and the Pit’ reviewed**<br>
_Quatermass and the Pit_ was the third of Hammer’s trilogy of adaptations of Kneale’s hit TV series chronicling the exploits of the ill-fated Professor Bernard Quatermass. It may lack the dark, visionary qualities of _Quatermass II_ (1958), but it’s streets ahead of its contemporaries, thanks in no small part to its audacious and complex plot.

Brilliantly scripted by Kneale with a storyline of breathtaking scope and imagination, _Quatermass and the Pit_ takes in alien invasion, demonic possession and the birth of many basic Christian precepts. The Martians’ infrequent psychic manifestations whenever their subterranean lair has been disturbed (during the sinking of a well, for instance, and the construction of the original Hobbes Lane tube station) result in sightings of demons, the grasshopper creatures resembling traditional Christian images of the Devil. Kneale’s hypothesis is that the Martians not only jumpstarted the human race by artificially speeding up evolution, but indirectly created witchcraft, demonology, Satanism and a good percentage of Christian demon mythology. The implications are startling, that the Martians have been – either consciously or otherwise – moulding human culture and belief since we first fell out of the trees and stood upright, implanting race memories that have haunted us ever since.

Kneales’ concise and witty screenplay is as peppered with subtleties and nuances as one might expect. Kneale is never content with merely telling a story, involving himself instead on creating a fully self-consistent scenario brimming with in-references and asides. The alien spacecraft, for instance, is at first misidentified as a ‘Satan’, a form of German secret weapon supposedly dropped on London during the war. Later, the inhabitants of the spaceship are found to be three-legged, a conscious reference to Wells’s Martian invaders, perhaps. Kneale’s cleverly demythologises the Christian legend of the Devil and offers a witty pseudo-scientific explanation for the occult. Like Stanley Kubrick’s _2001: A Space Odyssey_ (1968) made the following year, it suggests that Mankind’s destiny is not in its own hands and that it never has been – that basically, we’re little more than cattle in the eyes of a higher, inscrutable intelligence. And like Kubrick’s film, Kneale’s aliens truly are alien, enigmatic beings with a society and culture quite unlike our own.

_Quatermass and the Pit_ is a staggering achievement, well directed by Hammer new-boy Baker, a veteran of TV’s _The Avengers_. His handling of Kneale’s remarkable ideas is spot on, particularly in the apocalyptic finale, a sequence that seems to have inspired much of Tobe Hooper’s _Lifeforce_ (1985). It’s a film of great depth and intelligence, one that rewards repeated viewings. It combines Kneale characteristic attacks on authority and pomposity with his humanitarian attitudes and wide-ranging speculations on the nature of Man, evolution, the development of culture and the growth of religion.<br>
