A nonverbal and nonfiction cinematic project exploring the humanity of the Anthropocene.

Homo Sapiens is a species of bipedal primates characterised by dependence upon language and complex tools. Homo Sapiens (latin: Wise Man) has become the most influential biological species and a geological force on Earth, engendering a new epoch known as the Anthropocene: the age of the New Humans.

The Anthropocene is the unprecedented current epoch marked by mass human presence and activities, and is defined by accelerated change, unimaginable possibilities and complex uncertainties.

With a profound and expansive look at the human world full of crowds, spectacles and machines, _20-22 Omega_ – shot with a BOLEX camera on Kodak B&W film over 5 years across 100 locations – gives exclusive access to popular as well as rarely seen places, spectacular events and fascinating characters as the film shows a wide and diverse range of human environments, moments and operations.

Featuring a hypnotic soundtrack of Cathedral organ music, choir songs, Inuit throat singing, and without dialogue, this experiential/meditative documentary film offers us a unique cinematic symphony of evocative imagery and music, transcending the human language to reveal the new human reality known as Posthumanism.

As a postmodern take on the Early Avant-garde documentaries of the 1920s such as _Man with a Movie Camera_ (1929) by Dziga Vertov and _Berlin: Symphony of a Great City_ (1927) by Walter Ruttmann, a century later _20-22 Omega_ reprises that early cinema language/genre to bring us an abstracted portrait of the contemporary Western human world captured through the lenses and filmmaking techniques of the past.<br>
