Hogarth Hughes is an intelligent nine-year-old who befriends a 50-foot alien robot, which recently landed in the United States and is being hunted by government agents who believe that it means them harm. Working together, Hogarth and the robot must outsmart their pursuers. Recognised as an animated classic, Brad Bird’s (_Ratatouille_, _The Incredibles_) film is a celebration of friendship that raises profound questions about war and the environment.

**In the written text, under either name, the iron man/giant comes from the sea to England, and the story is not set in any particular year; but in this ﬁlm version the iron man/giant seems to be from another galaxy, and the story is located ﬁrmly in the USA of October 1957, when the Russians launched the ﬁrst-ever satellite – the Sputnik – into outer space.**

**Before working on this adaptation and relocation, director/co-writer Brad Bird made his name in animation through his involvement in various successful TV series, including _King of the Hill_ and _The Simpsons_. Asked why he wanted to switch to a very different type of subject and take on the 30-month challenge of animating for the cinema, he replies: ‘I think any material is right for animation if you approach it in the right way. The medium has certain strengths and weaknesses; if you play to its strengths, any story can be told. I think animation’s strength is caricature, and that if you have an element to your story that lends itself to caricature, then you’re pretty much home free.’**

In relation to the speciﬁc appeal of _The Iron Giant_, Bird goes on: ‘I suppose what attracted me to this project was the response you get to the mythology of a big metal man and a little, kind of helpless, human. These can both be presented as caricatures. But then our adaptation of the story turns things around by presenting the iron man as the child, while the ‘helpless’ human is the one that acts like a powerful adult. So, even though they are visually presented one way, in actuality they are something a little different.’

The presentation of this big-little relationship, though it is the key to the story, was the most difﬁcult aspect of the production because, partly for reasons of economy, the boy and the giant were animated by different methods. While the giant was drawn by computers, Hogarth (the boy) was brought to life by artists drawing him by hand. ‘Our challenge at the beginning of the project’, Bird explains, ‘was to make it seem to audiences that the giant and the boy were operating in the same world as each other. We worked very hard to create that impression; in order for the ﬁlm to reach audiences, it was essential to get it right. What we had to try to do was understand what makes hand-drawn animation look hand-drawn, and get the computers to come closer to that, rather than make the hand-drawn stuff look more computerised.’

In line with his work on _The Simpsons_, Bird wanted _The Iron Giant_ to appeal to adults and children equally. ‘I like fast-paced things as much as anybody’, he says, ‘but I think there is – for want of a better phrase – an “MTV-isation” of movies. I think it’s a sickening attitude that basically assumes that we all have the attention span of gnats, and are deaf as well. I don’t think that’s true of children any more than it is of anybody else. I would say that this ﬁlm is ﬁne for kids of six and up even though it is a little sophisticated and has no lowbrow humour.’ Actor-singer Harry Connick Jr, who provides one of the adult voices in the ﬁlm, agrees with Bird, saying: ‘At last I’m in a ﬁlm I can show my kids with pride.’
