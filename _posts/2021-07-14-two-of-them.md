**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

Both compromised by inadequate marriages, two women become entangled in a friendship that transcends age and social class. Monori and Nowicki, in roles that were written for them, reunite to play a destructive couple. It’s their passion, despite their difficulties, that shows Mari (Vlady) the hidden tragedy of her own marriage. Meanwhile, silently, the troubled couple’s child (Czinkóczi, seen later in the Diary films) bears uncomfortable witness to the lies of adulthood.<br>

In _The Two of Them_, Mari (Marina Vlady), a seemingly happily married middle-aged woman, who runs a centre for maladjusted young mothers, befriends the young, rebellious Juli (Lili Monori). Where Mari is steady and calm, Juli is impulsive and not a bit arrogant, attributes which make it easy to dismiss her.

Juli is married to a bright but hopelessly implosive alcoholic, Bodnár (Jan Nowicki). Yet at no point does Mészáros present her as a victim. Thanks to Juli, Mária begins to see the cracks in her own marriage and worldview, and their friendship, their transindividuality within the greater context of the women’s home, allows them to move forward.

_The Two of Them_ is then very much a film about a clash, of generations, values and attitudes, as seen from women’s point of view. The most suggestive is the scene between Juli and Mari’s conservative, emotionally distanced husband, in which Juli’s bluntness and her firm belief that Mari’s need for self-determination has lain dormant meet with smug hostility.

Is it because Juli defies the status quo, but hasn’t articulated how to build on this knowledge? An accusation that, to some extent, echoes Whit Stillman’s exasperation [during an event at 2019 Berlinale] that he cannot see what Jovana Reisinger’ short _Pretty Girls Don’t Lie_ (2018) and Susanne Heinrich’s _Aren’t You Happy?_ (2019) collage-like, deconstructive tactics lead to – a comment that goes to the heart of what we expect from cinema. In Mészáros’s case, I think we can say that her fictions help us see the injustices in the imbalance of power, and acknowledge that historical truth lies on young Julia’s side.<br>

A story of a friendship between two women of different classes and of their respective marriages. For 20 years, Mari has been living in a seemingly happy, harmonious marriage, and has been appointed director of a hostel for woman workers in the country. She gives shelter to the younger woman – her marriage with an alcoholic husband is an obvious mess. Mari, under the impact of her incipient friendship with Juli, is just beginning to realise that her domestic bliss of 20 years was in fact merely a formal, conventional pretence, a sham, a cloak under which she gave up her individuality.

Beside her two main actors, Lili Monori and Jan Nowicki, Márta Mészáros invited great international actors to this semidocumentary-like feature production; this is the only film shot together by the legendary Russian singer-actor Vladimir Vysotsky and his French love Marina Vlady. At the same time, the director discovered eight-year-old Zsuzsa Czinkoczi, from the rural farm near Kecskemet whom she cast in the role of Zsuzsi, Juli’s daughter.<br>

**A contemporary Review**
‘Nothing’s true! You all tell lies’, claims the neglected Zsuzsi at the end of  _The Two of Them_. It’s a fair accusation from the child who has seen her father in the worst stages of alcoholism and can’t be expected to sympathise with the reassuring report that he’s ‘getting along fine’. But as the trio of disconsolates run through a chilly dusk to the severe silhouette of their hostel home, we are left with the understanding that lies, too, can be necessary.

The conclusion is disturbingly honest, and represents not a reversal but an extension of Márta Mészáros’ previous film _Nine Months_. Where this first account of the early relationship of Juli and Janos (from which, mysteriously, Juli’s son has now disappeared) concerned itself with a determinedly candid heroine who pays the price for her honesty, _The Two of Them_ concludes bleakly that solitude is poor compensation for being in the right. Here, the characters deceive themselves, recognise the deceit, and are resigned to continuing the sham. They have no choice, not particularly because it’s a man’s world – they inhabit very much a female environment – but because their lives and emotions have worked out in no other way.

As Mari says, ‘It’s not truth, but loneliness I fear most’. She has achieved the independence that Juli had to struggle for in _Nine Months_, and achieved it comfortably except in matters of the inescapable (such as sex, which is also Juli’s problem), but the victory, if such it be, is unrewarding. The melancholy case is loaded, perhaps, by the scripted inadequacies of the male characters, who are portrayed more as insensitive near-rapists than reasoning partners, though one of them has apparently been supportive for 20 years of marriage.

But if _The Two of Them_ is less persuasive in its dissatisfactions than the very direct malaise of _Nine Months_, it is handled with equal assurance in style. Once again, Janós Kende’s photography is superb, and the conversation pieces, face-to-face in stark close-up reminiscent of Bergman’s sessions of psychoanalysis, are crisply and emphatically written and edited. There’s a splendid single-shot scene in which Marina Vlady, brewing up a quarrel with her husband, cooks him a breakfast omelette and at crisis point hurls it, frying-pan and all, through the kitchen window – wish-fulfilment with a vengeance for many a galley-slave. The Vlady performance, in fact, is probably the best guide to the film’s elusive centre – it’s a performance, no hair misplaced, no eyebrow incautiously lifted. Watch, for instance, her Garboesque scene with an admirer in the snow, all subtle smiles and lingering glances. As Zsuzsi would say, nothing’s true...<br>
