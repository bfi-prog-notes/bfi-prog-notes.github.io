_Contains scenes graphic violence, scenes of a sexual nature and uses of homophobic language._

**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away the film’s ending.

After they’re both diagnosed with HIV, and following an act of violence, a queer odd couple take to the road with the motto ‘f--k everything’. From its tongue-in-cheek opening proclamation that describes itself as ‘an irresponsible movie’ to its nihilistic yet deeply moving ending, _The Living End_ is pure Gregg Araki – boisterous, uncompromising filmmaking from a pioneer of New Queer Cinema.

**A contemporary review**

‘Fuck the world’, screams the graffiti in the opening shot of this self-styled ‘irresponsible movie by Gregg Araki’, which is dedicated to ‘the hundreds of thousands who will die because of a big White House full of Republican fuckheads’. This anarchic shout reverberates through Araki’s low-budget, high-octane film. Executive produced by Jon Jost, the guru of the no-budget movie, _The Living End_ has an energy that belies its impoverished finances. The pace is fast-forward, and though it was shot on 16mm, its Californian sun-scalded images easily stretch to 35mm. Aesthetically and politically this is an instant film. It is immediate, desperate and intentionally disturbing, with its two HN positive heroes, lonesome cowboys for the 90s, who take to the road to get lost to an America that has betrayed them. Like _Swoon_ and _Poison_, _The Living End_ is a queer tale that makes a virtue out of the connection between homosexuality and criminality. In a rampantly homophobic culture Luke and Jon are inevitably beyond the law.

To begin with, Araki’s movie is almost playfully picaresque. The pair encounter a succession of archetypes _en route_, ranging from two women in an open-top Chevrolet (a manifestly lesbian Thelma and Louise) and a trio of thugs out for gay blood, to quarrelsome couples in car parks. The depiction of women is open to criticism, particularly in the case of the wife who murders her philandering husband after reminding him that the fashionably bisexual 70s are over. But she belongs with the other pop-up ciphers who are negligible in the final analysis. Besides the two male protagonists, the only other rounded character is Darcy. She is a sympathetic presence who somewhat redeems Luke and Jon, and a touchstone for the audience as the two lovers skid out of control (although the role is hardly the caricature ‘fag hag’ it has been accused of being, it is weakened by Darcy Marta’s irritatingly melodramatic performance).

Sex and death drive _The Living End_ forward, shadowing it with a terrifying fatalism. Indeed, death is figured everywhere, from bumper car stickers to cut-away shots of wasted bodies. The studiedly morose Jon (his music heroes include such poets of angst as Joy Division, Echo and the Bunnymen and Morrissey) writes his thesis on ‘The Death of Cinema’ in his room decorated with Godard and Jarman posters. This _fin de siècle_ necro-romanticism suggests, a little too self-consciously, that culture is about to implode. Meanwhile, cool Luke, a James Dean _manqué_, taunts Jon with a ‘Live young, die young and leave a beautiful corpse’ credo. With his bare bronzed torso, his fashionably ragged jeans and cigarette hanging from the corner of his mouth, he represents the homoerotic ideal of hard masculinity. This iconography is echoed in the hoardings advertising Marlboro cigarettes and cowboy boots that flank the roads during the couple’s journey. The libidinous Luke endows their relationship with a remarkable sexual charge. The eroticism disappears, however, in the shockingly poignant final scene when Luke seeks ultimate abandonment in self-annihilation while telling Jon that he loves him more than life. This uncompromising and uncomfortable equation of sex with death makes _The Living End_ a film dangerously lacking in hope, which leaves its two heroes stranded on the beach.
