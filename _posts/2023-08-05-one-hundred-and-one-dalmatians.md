**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

One of the most delightful notions in Disney’s _One Hundred and One Dalmatians_ is that domesticated dogs see humans as their pets, to protect and make happy. It’s a joke for both parents and children, though perhaps kids relate to it more. As in many children’s stories, normal power frameworks are inverted, and the (literal) underdogs are in charge. Later, though, we’re shown this is a lie. A Dalmatian couple, Pongo and Perdita, have their beloved puppies stolen, and are frantic for news. While walking ‘their’ humans, Pongo barks his plea, but is pulled away by the man who’s now plainly his master.

At this point, the film becomes a different kind of fantasy, in which a parallel animal society works heroically to save the pups. It’s a precursor to _Toy Story_’s parallel world of playthings, and like _Toy Story_ this isn’t a simple children’s film. Rather it’s a comedy-thriller, mixing _The Great Escape_’s derring-do with Hitchcock’s playful suspense. In one marvellous scene, a brave cat tries to marshal the kidnapped pups into fleeing their prison, while their captors watch a TV gameshow where toffs quiz criminals (‘Did you… do someone in?’). Earlier the dogs saw an adventure show, containing all the thrills (a maniacal villain, fast-flowing rivers) they must later face for real.

Visually, _One Hundred and One Dalmatians_ moved Disney into graphics-led modernism, when most of the studios who’d championed the style as a reaction against Disney – most famously, UPA – were on the way out. As often happens in animation, the aesthetic came from cost-cutting technology. Mickey Mouse’s first animator, Ub Iwerks, developed a variant of the Xerox process (‘Xerography’) that transferred animated drawings to cels without the need for tracing. The characters were defined by black outlines which Walt disliked. However, the film’s designer/art director Ken Anderson envisioned a cartoon built out of those lines.

The style snowballed. In the final film, lines are the measure not just of the characters but the backgrounds as well. Painter Walter Peregoy’s loose, mood-creating colour blotches and the Xeroxed lines look like what they are – separate elements of a picture, kept apart for deeper stylistic harmony. The spotted opening-titles have the visual puns, spiky unpredictability and self-referencing of an ad campaign. (Peregoy’s colours wash over the screen when his credit comes up.) Pongo – whose cut-out style hind leg in the first scene is brazen for Disney – even inspects a chic art magazine, _Lilliput_.

The outlines redefine motions, especially the characters’ struggles for traction. When the pups slide on a frozen river, the outlines convey the contact of an ice surface even more than _Bambi_’s famous skating. The characters are infused with modern voices. Pongo narrates the opening like a cooped-up bachelor, following the suburban comedy of Disney shorts such as _Donald’s Diary_ (1954). His ‘pet’ human Roger, an impish bluesy songwriter, supplies an almost-naturalistic diegetic soundtrack.

Parents, not orphans, are valorised, and Pongo and Perdita are grown-ups who know their enemy. Wholly animated by Marc Davis, the dog-skinning devil Cruella De Vil is a customised, bisexual fiend, with her black-and-white hair, sallow skin, goblin cheeks, phallic car and cigarette-holder, and swathing fur coat. She was partly inspired by the overbearing actress-personality Tallulah Bank, whom Orson Welles called ‘the most sensational case of the ageing process being unkind.’ In a cartoon so broad, the metaphorical devils are no different from real ones. Cruella hurls a bottle into a fire where it explodes in orange smoke.

The film’s slightly odd structure – Pongo and Perdita almost vanish in the middle act – matters less than the moment-to-moment thrills. The puppies’ trudge through snow swells into an epic, and their final perilous escape in a furniture van finds suspense in artful animation cycles, as the identical dogs creep past the villains. The film delighted animators, critics and audiences. It did not please Walt. Ken Anderson recalled, ‘(Walt) said, “We’re never going to do another one of those goddamned things like Ken did...” He didn’t talk to me for about a year.’
