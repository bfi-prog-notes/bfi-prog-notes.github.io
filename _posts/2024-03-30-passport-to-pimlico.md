By general consent the best of writer T.E.B. Clarke’s six Ealing comedies, _Passport to Pimlico_ arguably best exemplifies studio head Michael Balcon’s description of Ealing’s post-war films as ‘our mild revolution’.

But as with most of the studio’s output, the accent is on the ‘mild’, while the ‘revolutionary’ element is little more than play. Like Clarke’s _The Lavender Hill Mob_ (1951), which imagines a mild-mannered bank clerk turned master criminal (in the nicest possible way), _Passport_’s story allows its contemporary audience to play out a fantasy of escape – from the unending burden of rationing and postwar ‘austerity’, from government, from Britain – before delivering them safely back to the status quo. The events of the story are more like a holiday – as suggested by the very un-British heatwave, which comes to an immediate end once the Burgundians rejoin Britain.

The film has been described by some as ‘anarchic’. But after the initial starry-eyed celebration of new-found freedoms – which amounts to one long, boozy, after hours knees-up – has passed, the Burgundians quickly install a makeshift government, restore the monarchy (in the form of the returning ‘Duke of Burgundy’) and implement a programme of civic building (a public lido).

Running through the film is a yearning nostalgia for the social unity of the war years, remembered fondly as Britain’s ‘finest hour’. This is most explicit in two sequences late in the film: the first a newsreel praising the fortitude of ‘plucky little Burgundy’ in the face of adversity – exactly the terms in which Britain saw itself in the early part of the war – and the second an extended montage in which the people of London come to the aid of the stricken Burgundians, throwing parcels of food from passing cars and trains – directly evoking the celebrated ‘Dunkirk spirit’.

This exploration of the British (or specifically English) character is at the heart of _Passport to Pimlico_. For all their dogged resistance, the Burgundians never lose sight of their true national identity, as the film’s most memorable line wittily makes clear: ‘We always were English and we always will be English, and it’s just because we are English that we’re sticking up for our right to be Burgundian!’

Director Henry Cornelius made no further films at Ealing, though he later directed the very Ealing-ish _Genevieve_ (1953) for Rank.

**‘Passport to Pimlico’: a contemporary review**  
The accidental explosion of a long-buried bomb in Pimlico reveals a hidden vault in which is found some treasure and a 15th century Royal Charter which decrees that the estate shall be forever recognised as Burgundian territory. The joyful reactions of the inhabitants upon finding themselves thus freed from the irksome restrictions still prevailing in post-war England, and the crazy situations resulting from their attempts to ‘go all French’, provide some hilarious comedy, until a few snags become apparent and ultimately a way out of the increasing difficulties is found.

Every line, every ‘gag’, is a little masterpiece of wit; each character, and indeed every individual member of the lengthy cast, provides a gem of comedy acting at its highest and best. Too much cannot be said in praise of this film, since it is genuinely funny and the humour and pace never flag.
