A young Indian boy who dreams of film stars sees his favourite actress come to Birmingham. Written by Tara Prem, this was one of the first British TV productions to feature an entirely Asian cast. The screening will be followed by an in-depth and illustrated career interview with Tara Prem hosted by Chantelle Lavel Boyea.

As producer of _Second City Firsts_, a series of half hour dramas by writers and directors new to television, she challenged the status quo, supported stories of under-represented people and championed diverse talent. Her production of Michael Abbensetts’ _Black Christmas_ starring Norman Beaton, led to the commissioning of the series _Empire Road._
