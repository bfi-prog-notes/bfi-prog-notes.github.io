In the second part of the Apu trilogy, Ray captures the pulsating spirit of the ancient city of Varanasi where Apu grows from child to adolescent. After his father’s death, Apu leaves to study in Calcutta, insensitive to his mother’s hard work to find money. Ray took bold artistic departures from the original novel, particularly in the strained mother-son relationship, and exquisite imagery and music brought epic dimensions to the film.

**A contemporary review**  
This is the second film of Satyajit Ray’s trilogy which began with the remarkable _Pather Panchali_. The boy Apu proceeds a little further along the road of experience; and the viewpoint of the film changes with his. Life is different now, and it is not merely the changes of scene which make it so. The voices of authority are the cultured scathings of the university teachers, no longer the squalling abuse of Mrs Muckerjee next door. Trains are no longer wonderful apparitions in enchanted paddy fields, but the familiar instruments of enlargement, of communication and separation. As town life grows to include not just streets and cars and electric light, but also friends, and village life shrinks in what it can offer. So, as the film goes on, does Apu’s mother seem smaller, less the mistress of every situation, no longer necessary to her son.

While _Pather Panchali_ was primarily a matter of experiences, _Aparajito_ shows Apu more in his personal and human relationships – above all in his changing relationship with his mother. The theme of the sacrifice which parents may make in equipping their children for a world which they can never really share – universal enough in itself – has rarely, if ever, been tackled by the Western cinemas, though in Japan Ozu has devoted 25 years and almost all his works to the exploration of this particular family relationship. Ray observes it all with remarkable insight and discretion; the mother overcomes her momentary unwillingness to give up her son to himself and his future; later, when she has given up the chance to have him beside her as she is dying, she has forlorn hopes and imaginings, as she hears the trains come by, that this last piece of self-sacrifice will not really be required of her. Apu’s momentary recognitions, his tactful deceit when he pretends to have missed the train, in order to make up for his roughness towards her, are equally real and touching. It is this observation and insight which makes Ray’s work so universal, and which show him as a director of outstanding promise, as well as achievement.
