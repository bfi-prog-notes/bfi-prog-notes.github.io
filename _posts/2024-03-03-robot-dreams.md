**What’s it about?**  
Living a solitary life and longing for fun and excitement, Dog sends off for a robot friend. When it arrives, the two make an immediate connection and Dog’s life is transformed. A trip to the park sees the two displaying disco dancing moves that Travolta could only dream of, but an unexpected event threatens their friendship. Told entirely without dialogue, _Robot Dreams_ is joyful and thought-provoking in equal measure, skilfully delivering its message to young and old alike.
