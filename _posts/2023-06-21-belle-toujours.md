I wasn’t expecting all that much from this follow-up to Buñuel’s 1967 masterpiece _Belle de Jour_, but any reservations disappeared the moment Michel Piccoli appeared on screen, twinkling with the kind of barely suppressed decadence Peter O’Toole can only dream of.

The now elderly Belle is played by Bulle Ogier, Catherine Deneuve having presumably refused. But the Piccoli of _Belle toujours_ is the same Monsieur Husson of the first film, now 40 years older, his lasciviousness and duplicity reduced to defiant alcoholism. Husson spots Belle at a concert, tracks her down with resourcefulness and bribes, and invites her to dinner.

This dinner scene is a marvel. The two elderly people race through the courses without exchanging a word, the only sounds being the clicking of cutlery and a series of chortling grunts from Piccoli. But what makes it fascinating is that it’s a rare instance of an arthouse star system in operation, since it relies on an awareness of the past careers of the two actors, both of whom tended to play characters defined by their sexuality – free in Ogier’s case, feral in Piccoli’s. Behind _Belle toujours_ twinkly, 82-year-old Piccoli lurks the amoral star of _Themroc_, _La Grande Bouffe_ and _La Belle Noiseuse_ – half a century of magnificent decadence.

The best films of Portuguese master Manoel de Oliveira exploit a fine, utterly unique tension. At first glance, everything is history, the past, memories: the architecture, paintings and music are ancient (or at least ‘classical’), the unresolved ‘backstories’ of the plot may go back several generations or even centuries, and the actors bring with them associations of their roles in many prior films (including Oliveira’s). And, of course, the filmmaker himself is, at the time of this release, pushing the age of 100. How could he not be preoccupied with the spectres of lost time, on every personal and political level?

And yet Oliveira’s films are also among the lightest, funniest and most ephemeral of contemporary cinema – as if his proximity to the prospect of shuffling off this mortal coil has engendered in him a droll, playful, even carefree attitude. His characters (whether youthful or elderly) frequently seem like ghosts, already halfway between the worlds of the living and the dead; and the usually heavy social environment seems itself transparent, illusory, veil-like.  The ‘immortal stories’ that he favours – ambiguous tales of love and obsession, idealism and disenchantment – frequently end on a quizzical note of detachment.

_Belle toujours_ is among Oliveira’s best. Introduced as a ‘homage’ to Luis Buñuel and screenwriter Jean-Claude Carrière, it begins from a speculative musing: what if Henri Husson and Séverine Serizy, characters in Buñuel’s _Belle de Jour_ (1967), were to meet again, almost four decades later? What would they say to each other? Oliveira hoped to cast both the original stars, Michel Piccoli and Catherine Deneuve, in this curious ‘continuation’ of Buñuel’s story, but only the former agreed. In the event, it’s hard to imagine how the perhaps too-well-preserved Deneuve might have fitted into the brittle tone of this chamber-piece: Bulle Ogier brings as much fragility as toughness to the part, and above all an endearingly screwball body language which is a perfect match for Oliveira’s Tati-like long-shot exteriors.

Is _Belle toujours_, in any ordinary sense, a sequel to _Belle de Jour_? In truth, the two films share very little – beyond the central characters, a mysterious ‘buzzing box’ like the one that so tantalised young Séverine (Oliveira needs only its sound, in a darkened, distant frame, for this gag) and a general atmosphere of plush, placid surrealism, a sense of the fantastic that is more latent than manifest. What makes _Belle toujours_ a sequel of a modernist or conceptualist kind is the fact that its animating question – what did Husson say to Séverine’s husband all those years ago? – is deepened to infinity, rather than resolved; we know less about the characters at the end of _Belle toujours_ than we did at the end of _Belle de Jour_.

_Belle toujours_ is a perfectly constructed jewel. The opening, long-held shot of an orchestra playing Dvorák’s Eighth Symphony introduces not only the musical score but a consistent mode of narrative punctuation: views of Paris at various times of day and night. Inside the Royal Vendôme restaurant where Husson and Séverine dine, the deliberately theatrical, declamatory dialogues that are Oliveira’s trademark are rendered with superb cinematic skill – no two angles on this space are alike and subtle surprises constantly await us. The magnificent comedy of Husson and Séverine’s elaborate meal is an inspired recreation (rather than imitation) of Buñuel’s method: the social _mise en scène_ of courses, manners and positions à table is meticulously observed. And, throughout, the strange procession of statues, paintings and other _objets d’art_ quietly dematerialises the human characters, turning them into almost abstract ‘figures’.

The ‘belle de jour’ of Buñuel’s title referred not only to a ‘beauty by day’ but also the blush of ‘morning glory’. Correspondingly, Oliveira’s ‘belle toujours’ conjures a beauty in eternal twilight – the glow we have come to recognise in his final, magisterial works.
