**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away the film’s ending.

Here, Dorothy Arzner’s instinct for story, casting and visuals are employed at the service of some of the era’s finest actors. Her third collaboration with Fredric March proved her star-making skills worked for men too. Businessman Jerry is in love with his secretary Julia and what begins as an office romance evolves into a love triangle with dangerous consequences. Arzner cynically plays on sex and social class distinctions to satisfying effect.

It takes Dorothy Arzner less than two minutes to upend expectations about where men and women belong in _Honor Among Lovers_. In a boardroom looking out on the New York City skyline, nine businessmen are deliberating on a deal. One associate is missing; the chair of the table calls in the absentee’s secretary. Arzner’s notions of secretarial duty, of course, went beyond typing and keeping tabs on a diary: when she arrived at Paramount Pictures as a typist herself in 1919, she already had aspirations to direct. And so Julia Traynor, played with characteristic poise and wit by Claudette Colbert, is not just any secretary in this feminist-minded film. By the end of the meeting, she has engineered approval for an audit on behalf of her employer – a man who would, for his part, rather plan cruises and pick out jewellery than do too much work.

Although this comedy has been billed as a ‘sizzling pre-Code love triangle’, _Honor Among Lovers_ is a more or less conventional narrative about an ambitious woman presented with two options for marriage: her employer, Jerry Stafford (Fredric March), and a broker, Phillip Craig (Monroe Owsley). Bed-hopping is minimal and the rapport – while it has a few flirtatious winks – not half as ribald as ‘sizzling’ might suggest. What the pre-Code moment allowed the lesbian filmmaker was not so much naughtiness as a chance to cast doubt on the value of matrimony. Set the year after the Wall Street Crash, _Honor Among Lovers_ mirrors bad investments on the market with bad investments in affairs of the heart. Our heroine might be empowered to make decisions on her own and of her own – but in this romantic comedy tapped into calamitous numbers on stock tickers, her speculation about who to wed is not always sound.

**Arzner on ‘Honor among Lovers’**  
Honor among Lovers _was one of the first Ginger Rogers films. Did you discover her? Was her famous ‘stage mother’ found on the set during shooting?_

Ginger Rogers was a star in _Girl_ _Crazy_ in the theatre. I saw her and liked her and requested her for a small part in _Honor among Lovers_. Paramount gave me about everything I wanted after _Sarah and Son_ and _Anybody’s Woman_, so I imagine they offered her much money. She could also continue playing in _Girl Crazy_ at the same time. I never saw her mother.

Honor among Lovers _ends with Julia, the married woman, going on an ocean voyage with a man not her husband. Was this unorthodox ending your choice? Was there pressure to have Julia finish the movie in the arms of her husband?_

I collaborated in the writing of _Honor among Lovers_, which I made for Paramount in New York. As audiences were ready for more sophistication, it was considered the smartest high comedy at the time.

No, there was no pressure regarding the script, I had very little interference with my pictures. Sometimes there were differences in casting, sets or costumes, but usually I had my way. You see, I was not dependent on the movies for my living, so I was always ready to give the picture over to some other director if I couldn’t make it the way I saw it. Right or wrong, I believe this was why I sustained so long – 20 years.
