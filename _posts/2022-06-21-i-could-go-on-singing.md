**A contemporary review**  
Movie stars have been rather out of fashion ever since Hollywood discovered the Actors’ Studio, and an audition by Lee Strasberg became a smarter testimonial than the hunting cries of the fans on the neon-lit pavements. It’s good to be reminded, though, that there are still occasions when the star can do it all on his (or more often her) own; can take the picture by the scruff of its neck in the first sequence, and hang superbly on to the end. _I Could Go On Singing_ is of this order. The plot (script by Mayo Simon) comes out of that drawer of serviceable show business remnants labelled ‘can a star also be a good wife and mother.’ The co-star (Dirk Bogarde) is generously self-effacing; the minor players (Aline MacMahon, Jack Klugnian and a likeably direct child actor, Gregory Phillips) know their places and keep to them. Direction, by Ronald Neame, is so flat as to be almost ironed out.

The total purpose, object and achievement of the film is contained in Judy Garland’s performance; and even performance, here, is a word to be used diffidently, since the essence of her quality – as actress, if not as singer – has always been her ability to seem not to be performing. What other actress, playing a big emotional scene, would keep dabbing so ineffectively at a tear-stained face with the back of a distracted hand? What other actress would get quite such an edge of nervous tension into the moment when she first walks on to the Palladium stage, keyed up to confront not just an imaginary audience in a film, but any audience, any time? Playing, as in _A Star Is Born_, a part which draws obviously on her own experience, Judy Garland gives one a sense of the strain of life as Judy Garland. It can’t be too easy to direct her; and the film’s method, with some of the songs and duologues shot in long and almost uninterrupted takes, suggests a wariness of breaking a mood, snapping that taut line of emotional concentration.

As a film, _I Could Go On Singing_ is threadbare, as well as being pinned down to those mid-Atlantic attitudes which make so much play with a helicopter tour of London (ending, on a wild stroke of extravagance, in the churchyard at Stoke Poges), or a camera reverently tracking over the frontage of the Savoy. But Judy Garland imposes her own kind of urgent truth, in the spontaneity and the raw nerves and the fortissimo slamming home of the songs. There is no counterfeiting this sort of talent.
