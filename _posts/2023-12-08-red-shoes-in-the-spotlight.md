Join us to dive deeper into the breathtaking world of Powell and Pressburger’s Technicolor masterpiece. Pamela Hutchinson, author of the recently published BFI Film Classics book on _The Red Shoes_, will present an illustrated talk examining some of the elements that make the film so endlessly fascinating. She will then be joined by special guests to consider the film’s wide-reaching influence on cinema and other artistic forms.
