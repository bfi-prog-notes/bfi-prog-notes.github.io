**Speakers**  

**Lavinia Brydon** is a senior lecturer in film at the University of Kent, United Kingdom. Her interests centre on the issues of place in film and the wider arts. She has published on these interests in various journals including _Film Studies, Leisure/Loisir_ and _Journal of British Cinema and Television_. She also serves on the editorial board of the journal Short Film Studies.

**William Fowler** is Curator of Artists’ Moving Image at the BFI National Archive where he acquires, restores and curates films. His projects have included Queer Pagan Punk: Derek Jarman, the biggest ever UK retrospective of Jarman’s films, and This Is Now: Film and Video After Punk which toured internationally in collaboration with artist moving image agency LUX. He is co-author of _The Bodies Beneath: The Flipside of British Film and Television_ published by Strange Attractor Press in 2019.

**Victor Fraga** is an Anglo-Brazilian journalist, filmmaker and exhibitor. Born in Brazil and based in London for 25 years, he is the founder and director of DMovies (aka Dirty Movies), the portal for thought-provoking cinema, one of the leading indie film publications in the UK since 2016. He has recently directed two films, _The Coup d'Etat Factory_ and _The Flour Test_, showcased in festivals and cinemas on both sides of the Atlantic. Victor believes that cinema is a powerful transformational tool on a personal, social and also political level. This vision is reflected on DMovies and his films. Victor is also a film exhibitor: he organises screenings and events across the British capital, also through DMovies. In 2020, Victor interviewed Peter Greenaway for three hours as part of a tribute for _Doesn't Exist_ magazine.

**Daniel Graham** worked in film distribution and film journalism for several years, interviewing directors such as Claire Denis, Theo Angelopoulos, Ousmane Sembène, Alexander Sokurov, Béla Tarr, Nuri Bilge Ceylan, Aki Kaurismäki, Mia Hansen-Løve and Lucile Hadžihalilović.

He wrote and directed his feature film debut in 2016, _Opus Zero_, an independent art house movie shot in Mexico with Willem Dafoe and Andrés Almeida. In 2019, Graham completed his second film _The Obscure Life of the Grand Duke of Corsica_, starring Timothy Spall and Peter Stormare, about a straight-talking architect who builds a mausoleum for a dying billionaire. More recently, Graham completed the 19th century boxing film _Prizefighter: The Life of Jem Belcher_ with Academy Award Winner Russell Crowe, Ray Winstone, Màrton Csokas, Jodhi May and Steven Berkoff.
