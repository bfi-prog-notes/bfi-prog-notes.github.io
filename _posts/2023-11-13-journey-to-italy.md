_+ extended introduction by Jeremy Cooper and Ben Rivers, with a reading by actor Toby Jones_

‘Brian reminded himself that the reason why he was a regular at the BFI was because it made him feel part of something outside, in a very small way a player on the world stage of cinema. He felt one of “us”, a singular essential element, the committed viewer of film, a member of the audience. Without people like him to watch it, film did not exist and the brave work of directors like Güney, Kiarostami, and other politically motivated artists would be meaningless.’

_Brian_ is **Jeremy**  **Cooper**’s seventh published novel. His latest work of non-fiction, _Postkartenkilometer. European art cards_ is the substantial catalogue to an exhibition from 10 November 2023 to 18 February 2024 at Dresden Kupferstich-Kabinett, celebrating his gift to the museum of over a thousand artists’ cards. Cooper gifted a similar number of works to the British Museum, exhibited in 2019 as _The World Exists to be Put on a Postcard_. His novel _Ash before Oak_ won the first Fitzcarraldo Editions Novel Prize in 2018.

**Ben Rivers** has made around 40 films. His films tread a line between documentary and fiction, often following people who have in some way separated themselves from mainstream society, creating oblique narratives imagining alternative existences. He has won multiple awards including the EYE Art Film Prize; FIPRESCI International Critics Prize, 68th Venice Film Festival for his first feature film _Two Years at Sea_; Baloise Art Prize, Art Basel; and twice winner of the Tiger Award at Rotterdam Film Festival. He was commissioned by Artangel to make _The Two Eyes Are Not Brothers_, shown at the former BBC Television Centre and The Whitworth Museum, Manchester. He is currently working on a sequel to _Two Years at Sea_ called _Bogancloch_.

**Toby Jones** is a widely recognised and respected British actor, known for his remarkable performances across stage and screen. With an illustrious career spanning more than three decades, he has achieved widespread acclaim and success in various roles.

After training at Manchester University then in Paris under Jacques Lecoq Toby formed a theatre company to devise and perform original plays and stories. He toured this work to theatres and festivals around the world. At the same time he began to work in repertory theatre and became the inaugural Artist in Residence at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in 1996. He directed and taught there over the course of a year’s association. He continues to teach and lead workshops in improvisation, devising and technique most regularly with Complicité and the National Theatre.

In his West End stage debut, Toby worked under the direction of Kenneth Branagh in _The Play What I Wrote_, earning him the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Supporting Actor. He has worked regularly at the National Theatre, the Almeida, and the Royal Court. Notably, in 2020, he made a triumphant return to the West End as the title role in Conor Macpherson’s adaptation of Chekhov's _Uncle Vanya_, receiving an Olivier nomination for Best Actor.

On screen Toby has most recently been seen in _Empire of Light, The Wonder, Tetris_ and earlier this summer in _Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny_. Other films include _Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy, Berberian Sound Studio, The Mist, Dad’s Army, Journeys End, Hunger Games, Frost/Nixon, Captain America._ He played Truman Capote in _Infamous_ and voiced Dobby the House Elf in the Harry Potter series. He recently finished filming _The Instigators_ with Matt Damon and Casey Affleck.

On television Toby is best known as Lance Stater in Mackenzie Crook’s series _Detectorists_ for which he received the BAFTA for best Comedy performance. He played Alfred Hitchcock in the HBO film _The Girl_ and Neil Baldwin in _Marvellous_. This autumn he will be seen in _The Long Shadow_ and as Alan Bates in _Alan Bates versus the Post Office_. Other television appearances include _Elizabeth, Doctor Who, Sherlock, The Secret Agent._ With Tim Crouch he co-wrote and starred in _Don’t Forget the Driver_.

He has recently co-adapted Italo Calvino’s _If on a Winters Night a Traveller_ with Tim Crouch and this will be recorded live for Radio Four at the Leeds Playhouse.

In recognition of his remarkable contributions to the field of drama, Toby was awarded an OBE during the Queen's New Year's Honours List in 2021.

**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away the film’s ending.

Quite simply, _Journey to Italy_ is a very, very great film. A landmark in many respects. One of those masterpieces which feels as if it’s becoming a little harder to ‘fix’ with each and every viewing. Surely no question, then, that the BFI should revive the film.

No question? Actually, once upon a time there might have been a great many questions. _Journey to Italy_ – aka _Viaggio in Italia_ or _Voyage to Italy_, or even  
_The Lonely Woman_ or _Strangers_ as it’s sometimes been known (though I’ve never heard it called _The Italian Trip_ or _The Curmudgeonly Man_, which would be almost as appropriate as some of the aforementioned titles) – wasn’t always held in the high esteem it commands today.

Rossellini first attracted the attention of the world with _Rome, Open City_ (1945) which, like its immediate successors _Paisà_ (1946) and _Germany, Year Zero_ (1947), pretty much conformed to the notion of neorealist films as stories of the everyday lives of the poor and dispossessed – ideally played by non-professionals – simply trying to get by. (This, of course, is a gross simplification of what neorealism was about, but that’s how it’s often described and discussed.)

But to many – with the very notable exception of _Cahiers du cinéma_ critics like Eric Rohmer, Jacques Rivette and Jean-Luc Godard – _Journey to Italy_ seemed something of an aberration. For one thing, it was about upper-middle-class types (what’s more, they were English!). For another, the lead roles were played by established stars (Ingrid Bergman, then the director’s partner, and George Sanders). And then there didn’t appear to be a proper story. The couple it depicted just seemed to be bored. They didn’t really do anything.

Which only goes to show how hard it is to define ‘realism’. In many regards _Journey to Italy_ is truer to the banality of many people’s lives than the relatively dramatic storylines of _Ossessione_ (1943), _Rome, Open City_, _Bicycle Thieves_ (1948) and many other neorealist classics.

In depicting the relationship of the Joyces, whose boredom and frustration with each other after years of marriage are brought into much clearer relief when they abandon the comfort zone of home and everyday habits for a trip to Naples and its environs, Rossellini simply lets the couple slowly drift apart from one another, each forced to fall back on all too recognisably limited resources. Nothing extraordinary occurs; they merely respond, in their tellingly different ways, to the sights, sounds and inhabitants of the unfamiliar world around them.

But it’s not just in terms of narrative that _Journey to Italy_ feels somehow more ‘truthful’ than many of the neorealist films. It’s in the overall focus. Rossellini’s sense of the importance of the social, political and material realities of the world around his central characters was as acute as ever, but what distinguishes this film from its predecessors is the attention he paid to their inner lives: the subtle nuances of the thoughts and feelings which they themselves seem often to barely comprehend.

There is an acknowledgement here of profound mysteries at work, and it feels as if Rossellini was determined to try and shed light on those mysteries, even as he made clear that there would be no easy answers to why his characters do what they do.

In this regard, the film moved beyond neorealism, towards another realm populated by figures like Carl Dreyer, Ingmar Bergman, Michelangelo Antonioni, even Rohmer or – more recently – the likes of Krzysztof Kieslowski, Abbas Kiarostami and Nuri Bilge Ceylan. Indeed, it might even be argued that, along with the earlier _Citizen Kane_ (1941), it was _Journey to Italy_ which was most instrumental and influential in effecting the transition from traditional forms of cinematic storytelling to something more recognisably modern. And that’s probably why the film itself feels so timeless.
