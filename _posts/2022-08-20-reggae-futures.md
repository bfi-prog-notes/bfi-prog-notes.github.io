A defining factor of reggae over the decades has been how, as the music perpetually shifts, the sound system culture remains constant; what began as Jamaican has adapted to new audiences and environments but always stayed true to itself. Nowhere is this more pertinent than in the UK. Reggae Futures celebrates the uniquely British approach to contemporary reggae. With a selection of film extracts, join author and season curator Lloyd Bradley, along with a panel of Black British music’s finest (including Smiley of Shut Up and Dance, Nathan at Reprezent, and DJ Flight), to celebrate the best of this musical revolution and contemplate where it might go next.  

**PANEL**  

**Lloyd Bradley**  
Lloyd Bradley is one of the UK’s foremost black music experts and a seasoned cultural commentator both in print and in person.

His book _Bass Culture: When Reggae Was King_ remains the world’s best-selling book on Jamaican music and culture; the internationally acclaimed _Sounds Like London: 100 Years of Black Music in the Capital_ is the first and only to explore Britain’s modern black music as one continuous thread.

Lloyd is co-curator of the Black Cultural Archive’s best-attended exhibition, _Black Sound: Black British Music’s Journey of Creative Independence_, was organiser and co-curator of 2015’s _Sounds Like London Film Festival_  – two days of films and talks about London’s black music history; and was Associate Producer of BBC2’s award winning series _Reggae: The Story of Jamaican Music_. He was among the UK’s first black pirate radio crew on the iconic _Dread Broadcast Corporation_; has compiled and written sleevenotes for numerous soul, funk and reggae albums; and has spoken and lectured the UK, the US and Jamaica black music and its socio-cultural resonance.

With a background of over 30 years as a music journalist – his CV includes _Mojo_, _Blues & Soul_, _The Independent_, _The Observer_, _Q_ _Magazine_, _Esquire_, _Smash Hits_, _Music Week_ and the _NME_ – Lloyd has lectured in journalism and magazine theory and presentation in the UK and the US, devising and delivering courses for media studies and journalism students.

He is currently writing _Funk Is Its Own Reward_, the story of 1970s soul music, which should hit the streets next year.

**DJ Flight**  
DJ Flight is widely regarded as one of the foundations of Drum & Bass and a pioneer of dance music. As a DJ and a radio presenter, she has been at the forefront of the scene’s transitional periods by championing underground music and eclectic producers. Flight draws attention from beyond the genre due to her exquisite live sets that emanate deeper shades of Drum & Bass.

Her most recent work includes _Turn It Up: A Short History of Drum & Bass_ on BBC Sounds (eps 1-4 out now; 5-8 dropping next week), and _Windrush Stories_ – Season 3 ‘Hackney Edition’ published in June. She is co-founder of EQ50, a collective of women addressing inequality and representation in Jungle D&B. In 2020, they launched the first ever multi-label mentorship programme for women and non-binary producers. 2022 marks 25 Years of DJ Flight, which will be celebrated with a series of global events.

**Nathan Nicol**  
Nathan Nicol is a broadcast producer at Reprezent Radio in Brixton.  His work there involves training and supporting the next generation of young creative talent, working as part of a small team to anticipate and adapt to the future of broadcast media, and supervising the lively, dynamic, and often challenging environment of live radio.

He oversaw the planning and delivery of Windrush Week at Reprezent in 2021, which included contributions from Baroness Floella Benjamin, Tippa Irie, Ragga Twins, Rudolph Walker, Fabio & Grooverider, Patrick Vernon OBE, Reprezent family members, and many others.

Nathan also DJs and produces music, and has had a love for what would become Grime since 2001. He is preoccupied at the moment with collecting instrumentals and vocals that showcase the link between Reggae and Grime, and was the instigator of a Dub-Grime fusion set, which you can enjoy on Reprezent’s YouTube page.

**Smiley**  
Way back in 1986 there were four guys named Smiley, PJ, DJ Daddy and DJ Hype. They had built a sound system called Heatwave and come the weekend they would break into many a house or warehouse (unoccupied of course) to start their own illegal raves, parties, knees-up, shindig, or shabeenz etc.... This was the done thing back then and Smiley and PJ were rappers on the sound system but were also trying to get a record deal. No record label would sign them up, and so after many knock backs they decided to start their own label, Shut Up and Dance Music.

Their first release was a track titled 5,6,7,8, which was sold straight out of the boot of PJ’s Ford Escort. Other singles followed quickly, £10.00 To Get In, £20.00 To Get In, Lamborghini, Derek Went Mad and pretty soon an album _Dance Before the Police Come_ which became an instant success. The label grew from strength to strength and soon the guys decided to expand by signing artists to their label and producing the tracks for them as well. These artists included: The Ragga Twins, Nicolette, Peter Bouncer, Rum and Black and Adé to name a few.

Perhaps best known for their classic track – ‘Raving I’m Raving’ which topped the UK singles chart in May 1992 , Smiley and PJ also started other record labels, Redlight (Drum & Bass), Ruff Quality (Experimental Breaks), and New Deal Recordings (2 Step/Garage breakbeat).

Various albums, Artist remixes, a weekly radio show on originuk.net, and constant DJ tours and gigs, is how the guys manage to unleash their sound upon the masses on a regular basis.

The guys are now getting ready to release their very own video documentary titled: _2 Facety Boys From Hackney_ the story of Shut Up and Dance music, which tells the Shut Up and Dance story in full; how they met, the music, the vibe, and the 30 year journey they have taken to get to where they are today.
