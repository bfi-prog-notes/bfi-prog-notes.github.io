Screening on the opening night of the I Will Tell International Festival is this coming-of-age romantic drama, set against the underground drum ‘n’ bass, acid and house music scene of ’90s London, and produced by Jason Matthewson. Sarah-Jane is a young aspiring jazz singer from Bournemouth who moves to London to embark on a music career. Not long in town, she falls for the handsome Airbeats, but also sinister music producer Russell-D, who represents a darker side to the music industry.
