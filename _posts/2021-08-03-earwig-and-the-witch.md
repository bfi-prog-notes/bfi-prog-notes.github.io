**What’s it about?**<br>

Ten-year-old orphan Earwig is taken in by a witch, who teaches her how to cast magic spells in return for helping around the house. With the aid of a talking cat, Earwig starts to learn about her true family. The latest film from Studio Ghibli is directed by Gorô Miyazaki (_Tales from Earthsea_) and sees the studio revisit the books of Diana Wynne Jones (_Howl’s Moving Castle_) while venturing into computer animation for the first time.<br>

**Hayao Miyazaki on ‘Earwig and the Witch’**<br>
I received _Earwig and the Witch_ from publisher Tokuma Shoten, which sends me children’s books every month. I love Diana’s books, and upon opening this one, I found it be very engaging. It’s extremely scathing and full of sarcasm, but also has a sprinkling of humour that doesn’t get buried, making it genuinely delightful. In a sense, it’s quite down-to-earth, in that it depicts the process by which a family comes together.

Earwig’s charm comes from her indomitable spirit. She has an unflappable strength and formidableness, and at the same time, she’s an adaptive and tenacious fighter. They’re the same qualities you need when making your way in the world, and those aspects of her character are particularly endearing. When people around us display hostility, we often tend to lose our nerve, shrink, and give up, but we can still somehow find a niche to cling on to, by our fingernails if need be, and use it to lift ourselves up. That’s the definition of formidableness. When times get hard, it enables you to maintain a positive outlook and endure hardship with a smile on your face.

The use of CG was impressive. That’s thanks to the truly wonderful team that came together for this project. Once the decision was made to work with CG, I wondered how it would be done, but when I saw the finished product, I had no complaints. Because it was drawn using CG, not pencils, it has a more deliberate quality. My praise comes with no reservations. It must have been a tough film to make. Earwig’s formidable ability to never give up and to dig her heels in permeates the picture.<br>
