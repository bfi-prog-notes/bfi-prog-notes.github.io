The latest from the director of _Portrait of a Lady on Fire_ and _Tomboy_ is a tender coming-of-age story revealing how a young girl responds to the changes in her life after the death of her grandmother.

Céline Sciamma returns to her roots with another beautifully crafted coming-of-age story. Eight-year-old Nelly is bundled into her car with her parents and taken to help pack up her recently deceased grandmother’s house, the home her mother grew up in. As her parents fill boxes and sift through possessions, Nelly traces her mother’s childhood steps, exploring the woods surrounding the house.
