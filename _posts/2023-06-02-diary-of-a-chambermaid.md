Buñuel updates Octave Mirbeau’s 1890s story to a strangely timeless 1930s and the onset of Fascism, so that Célestine (Jeanne Moreau), newly employed at a rural mansion, fends off the attentions of her married boss, his anti-semitic, perhaps paedophile gamekeeper, and his ex-army neighbour. Piccoli excels as the neurotic, lecherous master-of-the-house, while Moreau is wonderfully ambiguous as the maid prepared to take control.

**A contemporary review**  
There is a distinct air of paradox about Buñuel’s remake of the Octave Mirbeau novel previously filmed by Renoir. The novel would seem to fit Buñuel’s idiosyncratic talents almost too snugly, and yet, for all the relish with which he elaborates on the fetishistic and pathological elements of the story, the film emerges as curiously untypical. It is not merely that its polished, elegant surface contrasts equally with the harsh, explosive urgency of _Viridiana_ or _Nazarín_ and with that air of triumphing over obstacles that marks such films as _La joven_. More troubling is an uncharacteristic air of uncertainty, which seems to derive from a lack of clarity over the character and significance of Célestine, and a puzzling shift of focus midway through the film.

When one recalls the film in detail, however, these reservations seem no more than carping. The emotional and visual keynote of the film is struck early on in Célestine’s remark on the sadness of the countryside, and this underlying melancholy is maintained through all the different episodes and changes of mood in a masterly way. Buñuel’s superbly economical narrative skill keeps one continuously engrossed, and his command of cinematic resources is such that even the rather old-hat symbolism of the murder (shots of a wild boar, and a rabbit, beating wings on the soundtrack, and so on), makes a powerful impact. The Monteil household offers Buñuel scope for a corrosive analysis of the master-servant relationship, as well as serving as the perfect paradigm for his vision of society as hopelessly corrupt from top to bottom. Buñuel, moreover, has a sense of history and politics which enables him, while concentrating on his characters as individuals, to set them in their historical and social context with a deft conviction that goes much deeper than a merely conventional sense of period. Joseph, for instance, apart from being a sharply drawn personality in his own right, is also the definitive portrait of a certain type of petit bourgeois Fascist mentality.

One enjoys, too, the expected flashes of wickedly sardonic humour (the preposterous priest, for example, gravely evaluating for Mme Monteil’s benefit the propriety of various types of unorthodox ‘caresses’, and adding the stern proviso that she must on no account take pleasure from them), and one relishes especially the panache of Buñuel’s final flourish. Having peremptorily dismissed a parade of chanting Fascists from the screen, he mockingly tilts his camera up to a stormy, lightning-riven sky, a symbolic ending as richly suggestive as Antonioni’s street lamp in _L’eclisse_.

Buñuel, it should be added, is splendidly served by his collaborators: Georges Wakhevitch’s appropriately cluttered interiors and Roger Fellous’ evocative, grey-toned photography contribute tellingly to the film’s total effect. The cast, too, is uniformly excellent, particularly Georges Géret, Jean Ozenne and, of course, Jeanne Moreau. The film is almost worth a visit just to see how, with the merest twitch of that expressive mouth, she modulates from curiosity through amusement to boredom at Monsieur Rabour’s antics.
