_With a pre-recorded introduction by director Francis Lee._

Kevin Bacon plays Ren MacCormack, a city teen who relocates from Chicago to the Midwest sticks, where he finds that rock music and dancing have been banned by John Lithgow’s Bible-thumper. Lori Singer (who beat Madonna to the role) struts her stuff as Lithgow’s daughter Ariel, a sassy missy so keen to kick the small-town dust off her red cowboy boots that, as her friend Rusty (Sarah Jessica Parker) says, she ‘probably memorises bus schedules’.

A battle to stage a prom ensues, and for once the Hollywood diktat – that down-home values always vanquish city-slicking ways – is turned on its head.

It has you from the get-go: the opening sequence is a toe-tapping montage of variously attired pairs of feet dancing to Kenny Loggins’s title track.

Three decades on, Bacon’s vest-clad set-piece dance in a flour mill looks cheesily 1980s, but the rest of Ross’s drama wears its age well, real song-and-dance joy for the pre-_Glee_ generation.

**‘Footloose’: a contemporary review**

_Footloose_ is a combination of two proven formulae so obviously made for each other that their marriage seems to have been unaccountably delayed: the recent musical tradition of _Fame_, _Flashdance_ and _Saturday_ _Night_ _Fever_ and the 50s melodrama of rebellious youth and families in crisis (principally _Rebel_ _without_ _a_ _Cause_). Both conventions are openly acknowledged in a self-conscious updating of motifs and scenes. _Rebel without a Cause_ is the obvious precedent and the film’s major source: Ren/James Dean is the young outsider allied with his girlfriend Ariel/Natalie Wood (the victim of a repressive father) after the ritual of the chicken run (only here, through a nice irony, the hero wins because his clothing is caught in the machinery and he cannot jump clear). The film’s contemporaneity is meanwhile underlined through the imitation of recent successes. Ren’s dance in the warehouse, intercut with a dream sequence, is filmed a la _Flashdance_ (complete with gymnastic pyrotechnics, backlighting, tracking camera parallel to action, and rapid montage on spectacular leaps). Frequent references to _Saturday_ _Night_ _Fever_ (particularly in the final scene) combined with the teenage haunts of _Happy_ _Days_ complete the portrayal of today’s youth.

Interestingly, where the film departs most from _Rebel_ – in its selection of small-town religiosity rather than the family as the repressive force – is where it seems least coherent and confident. The character of the Reverend Shaw Moore, who is eventually shaken by the neo-Nazi activities of his parishioners and challenged by his wife and daughter, does not seem a strong enough figure to have been the dominant force for five years. The characters who directly support his teachings by burning books and the like, Roger and Eleanor Dunbar, remain mere cyphers, and there is little attempt to outline the small-town mentality against which Ren is supposedly rebelling. Within this scheme, the family becomes simply the staging ground for Ren and Ariel’s pained monologues, providing psychological motivation which borders on the fatuous (‘If you could explain to me about my father, maybe I could explain to you about your son ...’). The film thus avoids (or displaces on to the musical format) the issues which melodrama usually raises, and trades in analysis for a very obvious narrative design. An obviousness which the set-pieces do little to alleviate: an amusing montage of Ren teaching Willard to dance, Ren’s flash dancing in a moodily lit warehouse, and a finale which despairingly showers the screen with glitter. Ultimately, it is the celebration of teenage frustration as dance which reduces the issues to the level of platitude.
