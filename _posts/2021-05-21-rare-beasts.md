_+ Q&A with writer-director Billie Piper (on Saturday 22 May only)._

Mandy (Billie Piper) is a mother, a writer, a nihilist. Mandy is a modern woman in a crisis. Raising a son, Larch (Toby Woolf) in the midst of a female revolution, mining the pain of her parents’ separation and professionally writing about a love that no longer exists, she falls upon a troubled man, Pete (Leo Bill), who is searching for a sense of worth, belonging and ‘restored’ male identity.

_Rare Beasts_ is a pitch black comedy and is Billie Piper’s directorial debut.

**Director’s Statement**

It was important to me when making the film that the visual language of the film felt heightened and metaphorical. This is the world as Mandy sees it.  
For example, the women tapping their heads is actually a style of therapy called ‘tapping’ or EFT. You tap your energy meridians whilst using positive affirmations. I used this once with little effect but it inspired that part of the film. I wanted to use the idea of a female chorus – much like in a Greek tragedy to illustrate the crisis I saw in women around me. It’s not just Mandy’s experience but a shared depression.

_Rare Beasts_ as a gritty English style of filmmaking would have been unbearable. That of course has its place but I wanted it to feel slightly more balletic with scenes crashing into each other at breakneck speed! That is how I feel we experience life now; lots of things happen to us all day long and we receive an enormous amount of information all day long and lots of it is quite threatening information, further adding to today’s anxiety epidemic.

Everyone in this film is at the end of their rope. Niceties have failed the human race, small talk is done. When you live through nihilism – cynicism – hopelessness, your view of the world is not necessarily as it is but rather your projection. I wanted all the characters to speak frankly. I have known people in my life like this. If you’re from a working class background, there is a brutal shorthand, so this language doesn’t feel unfamiliar to me. In terms of Mandy and Pete – Mandy is a confused feminist, whenever she tries to take control and support the cause it’s always with a very confused approach.  
For example, in the opening scene Mandy addresses #metoo in a clumsy assertive way. This may shock the audience but further proves my point that we as women can’t say certain things any more that aren’t seen to be ‘cause appropriate’ which to me feels oppressive. More oppression, but this time by the same sex.

The language I used in the film can be interpreted as hard work and it may well not be your thing; that is ok. However, I would encourage you to try and look beyond your initial reaction which may be ‘that’s offensive to women’; you might think differently or you might not. I encourage debate and conversation.  
The film is dedicated to ‘all my friends and all their woes’ because this film definitely deals with issues we’ve discussed as friends. I definitely think our generation can relate to the panic attack feeling of life and that many women my age can vouch for being confused by some of modern feminism.
