_The screening on Wednesday 25 October will be introduced by director  Terry Gilliam._

Perhaps the most ferociously imaginative fantasy film Britain has ever produced, _Time Bandits_ – a violent, absurdist comedy for children – was animator-turned-director Terry Gilliam’s second solo film, following his 1977 debut, _Jabberwocky_. The script, by Gilliam and fellow Python Michael Palin, owed less to earlier British time travel movies, like _The Amazing Mr. Blunden_ (1972) or _Timeslip_ (1955), than to British fantasy literature, from Swift’s _Gulliver’s Travels_ to Tolkien’s _The Hobbit_ and C.S. Lewis’s Narnia stories via the comic science-fiction of Douglas Adams.

With a dreamlike atmosphere reminiscent of Lewis Carroll’s Alice and Mervyn Peake’s _Gormenghast_ trilogy (the latter one of Gilliam’s many unfulfilled projects), _Time Bandits_ gleefully de-romanticises history. Ian Holm’s Napoleon rants drunkenly that the world’s greatest conquerors have all been under 5’1”, while John Cleese’s Robin Hood greets the peasantry with all the vacuous courtesy of a royal dignitary at a charity function. David Warner plays the wonderfully malevolent villain, a human Swiss army knife known only as Evil, while Sean Connery lends human warmth to the picaresque as a kindly King Agamemnon (the only character in the entire movie who seems to care whether the child hero lives or dies).

The humour is surreal, spiteful and very funny, while Gilliam’s imagination goes berserk in the final half, set in a make-believe era known as ‘the Time of Legends’. Here we find an irritable ogre stricken with lower-back pain, a gormless sea giant, and the gothic vision that is the Fortress of Ultimate Darkness. The film’s £5 million budget evidently couldn’t keep up with Gilliam’s fevered visions, and a further two scenes had to be dropped (one involving a pair of spidery old ladies, the other a forest of monstrous hands).

The film’s imagination versus rationality theme climaxes with an ingenious skirmish in which a toy-littered bedroom becomes a sprawling battleground. Here the shape-shifting Evil creatively dismantles an army of cowboys, spaceships and tanks rallied from the annals of history. Even God Himself turns up (a priceless cameo from Ralph Richardson, looking like a slightly bewildered bank manager).

Despite favourable reviews, _Time Bandits_ did only mediocre business in Britain, where it was unhelpfully and misleadingly marketed as a Python film. Promoted as a children’s picture in the United States, however, it became a huge success, despite US distributor _Avco-Embassy_’s reservations about the audaciously cruel ending.
