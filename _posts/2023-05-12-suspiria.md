_Contains violence, gore and animal harm_

**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

Having flirted with the supernatural in _Deep Red_ (1975), Dario Argento abandoned the _giallo_ stylings of his earlier work altogether for the full-on sensory blitzkrieg of _Suspiria_, his first delve into the purely supernatural. Famously printed using the outdated and soon to be phased out Technicolor IB (imbibition) process (a system developed back in the late 1920s) and scored by the Italian progressive rock band Goblin who had so memorably scored _Deep Red_, _Suspiria_ looked and sounded like no other horror film of the 1970s. Although much-imitated since it remains one-off, an almost unclassifiable film that seems as determined to pummel audiences into submission as it does entertain them.

American ballet student Suzy Bannion (Jessica Harper) arrives in Germany to further her studies at the prestigious Freiburg Dance Academy. As soon as she arrives, a recently expelled student. Patricia (Eva Axén) is brutally murdered by an unseen assailant (as is often the case in his films the knife that deals the killing blow was wielded by Argento himself – he also narrated the Italian version). The next day, Suzy meets head instructor Miss Tanner (Alida Valli) and deputy headmistress Madame Blanc (Joan Bennett) and learning that her room isn’t ready, she accepts an offer to stay with bitchy fellow student Olga (Barbara Magnolfi). After being taken ill during a practice session, Suzy is relocated to the Academy’s accommodation where she befriends fellow student Sara (Stefania Casini). After a consignment of spoiled meat causes maggots to fall from the attic, the pupils are forced to spend the night in a makeshift dormitory and Sara confirms that the laboured breathing they hear coming from behind a curtain is that of the Academy’s founder, Helena Markos. The school’s blind pianist Daniel (Flavio Bucci) is fired when his dog attacks Blanc’s nephew Albert (Jacopo Mariani) and is killed when a supernatural force turns the dog against him, Sara is killed when she’s pursued by another unseen assailant and falls into a room full of razor wire and Suzy comes to suspect that the Academy is a front for a coven of witches.

Argento sets out his stall straight away, pitching Suzy into a nightmarish world that assaults both her and the audience the second she steps through those electric doors, out of the comfortable, brightly-lit and blandly familiar airport lounge and into the ferocious storm that accompanies her ride to the Akademie. Unseen by our soaked and bewildered heroine, the film’s first victim is meeting a spectacularly grisly end (the close-up of the knife puncturing Patricia’s beating heart was a step too far for the British censors who initially ordered its removal), the climax of a particularly intense sequence that Argento spins out for fifteen nerve-shredding minutes.

It’s not an entirely original observation to suggest that the film never quite recovers from this tour-de-force opening but there’s still a huge amount of weirdness to savour before we get to the fiery climax. The camera plummeting from the roof of the Staatliche Antikensammlung museum in Munich’s Königsplatz towards the doomed Daniel, swooping as though one of the building’s stone birds had come to life (its descent is accompanied by the unnerving sound of wings flapping) is extraordinary and the climactic destruction of the Academy, torn apart by the death of its founder, is a practical effects triumph.

As with _Deep Red_ there’s a degree of awkward humour in _Suspiria_ (comedy was never Argento’s forte) though the exaggerated bitchiness of the locker room scene is a welcome moment of light relief following the almost unbearable intensity of the opening scene. After that, there are the odd perhaps unintentionally funny lines (‘He’s really ugly, isn’t he?’ Tanner says of servant Pavlo (Giuseppe Transocchi), ‘Don’t be afraid to say so’) but Argento’s chief concern is slowly ramping up the tension again until Suzy finally gets to the bottom of the mystery, resulting in the destruction of the Academy and leaving Suzy where she started, soaked to the skin in a raging rainstorm.

The combined efforts of Argento, director of photography Luciano Tovoli and art director Giuseppe Bassan ensure that _Suspiria_ not only looked quite unlike anything else Argento had done so far but unlike any of its contemporaries. The Technicolor IB gives the film a glowing quality that emphasises the reds and greens that Tovioli bathes the action in (one astute critic at the time quipped that you could develop film in the crimson glow emanating from the screen) while Bassan’s glorious sets – including a giant recreation of the façade of the Haus zum Walfisch in Freiburg im Breisgau, which stands in for the Academy and the student halls that have a strange, ‘gingerbread house’ quality about them reminding viewers of the beleaguered children menaced by a cannibalistic witch in Hansel and Gretel. Tovoli’s cameras are restless, barely standing still for a second and he was the first Italian director of photography to make use of the recently developed Steadicam.

The score, a glorious cacophony of clattering percussion, bouzouki, weird susurrations and occasional screeching cries of ‘witch!’, is as wonderfully strange as the visuals. Written and recorded by Goblin (here credited as  
The Goblins) before filming began, it was played back on the set at deafening volumes to inspire and intimidate the cast. Switching instantly between a tinkling piano theme (a variation on the hymn ‘Jesus Loves Me’ by Anna Bartlett Warner) and an _avant garde_ onslaught of sound in which individual instruments are submerged in a skin-crawling soundscape, it’s the most experimental score of Argento’s career, often cited by keyboard player Claudio Simonetti as the band’s masterpiece.

The end result of this sensory overload is a film that begins with a bang then slowly gets under your skin until ending with a cathartic blaze that anticipates the title of the film’s sequel, _Inferno_ (1980). Those complaining that what little plot there is makes little sense are rather missing the point. _Suspiria_ doesn’t offer a story. Instead it offers an immersive experience that assaults you on every sensory level while its heroine drifts through a weird dreamscape where odd things happen seemingly out of the blue and where excess is the order of the day. The story hints at Grimm fairy tales and even Germany’s problematic recent past (Miss Tanner looks like she escaped the post-war _Entnazifizierung_ and the _bierkeller_ that Daniel repairs to after being fired is the Hofbräuhaus in Münich’s 9 Platzl where Hitler arranged his earliest meetings of what would become the Nazi party), but remains in a world all of its own, a nightmarish place where witches are real and exert unusual power – they ‘change the course of events, and people’s lives, but only to do harm’ according to expert Professor Milius (Rudolf Schündler).

_Suspiria_ was another hit for Argento, particularly outside Italy, and it inspired the director to position it as the first in a trilogy concerning the malign influence of the Three Mothers, a triumvirate of witches (inspired perhaps by _Macbeth_) who have built malevolent houses around the world. Markos was re-positioned as Mater Suspiriorum (the ‘Mother of Sighs’) with Mater Tenebrarum (the ‘Mother of Darkness’ played by Veronica Lazar) setting up shop in New York and Mater Lachrymarum (the ‘Mother of Tears’, played briefly by Ania Pieroni in _Inferno_ and Moran Aias in _La terza madre_ (2007)) in Rome. The even more dreamlike _Inferno_ followed in 1980 but there was a 27 year wait until the story was concluded in _The Third Mother/The Mother of Tears_.
