_We are pleased to announce that the BFI’s Hires and Sales Manager  Jelena Milosavljevic, film critic Christina Newland and film journalist and  Editor-at-Large for Empire magazine Helen O’Hara will join season curator Ruby McGuigan onstage for this panel discussion._

Behind every group of emotionally stunted cowboys, aviators or detectives lies a wise-cracking woman. Or so it seems in the films of Howard Hawks, where we find some of early Hollywood’s boldest heroines. But what made a woman ‘Hawksian’, and why did she disappear? Join our panel as we dig into the trope, examine its legacy and question what it really means to be ‘one of  the boys’.
