_+ panel discussion with actors Michael Ajao and Jumayn Hunter, hosted by  Dr Clive Chijioke Nwonka_

Joe Cornish’s 2011 sci-fi comedy about a group of youths defending their south London housing estate against an extra-terrestrial attack has achieved cult status. To mark the publication of Dr Clive Chijioke Nwonka’s forthcoming book _Black Boys: The Social Aesthetics of British Urban Cinema_ (Bloomsbury), this special event will look at how the film remains a powerful exploration of race and class, social stigma, housing, Black British identity and nationhood.

Joe Cornish first made his name as co-presenter (with Adam Buxton) of Channel 4’s _The Adam and Joe Show_ (1996-2001), fondly remembered for re-enacting big-screen blockbusters with the aid of cuddly toys. Although technically far slicker and entirely live-action, his uproarious aliens-versus-hoodies feature debut _Attack the Block_ betrays a similarly encyclopaedic genre knowledge, especially the Roger Corman-influenced films of the 1970s and 1980s that never allowed their high IQs and sociopolitical awareness to breach the fundamental requirement that they move like electrified greyhounds, preferably clocking in at under 90 minutes to facilitate drive-in double-billing.

Accordingly, _Attack the Block_’s premise about an alien invasion and the ensuing siege of a single South London housing estate has umpteen nods to John Carpenter’s _Assault on Precinct 13_ (1976), _Escape from New York_ (1981) and _The Thing_ (1982), Walter Hill’s _The Warriors_ (1979) and _Streets of Fire_ (1984), Joe Dante’s _Gremlins_ (1984) and the John Sayles-scripted _Piranha_ (1978) and _Alligator_ (1980), with a dash of French _cinéma du look_ (_Diva_, 1981; _Subway_, 1985) and a Children’s Film Foundation romp thrown in for good measure. However, Cornish never falls into the trap of creating gags around lazy name-checks.

Here the milieu is wholly convincing. The ‘block’, the fictional Wyndham Tower estate, hosts not just the film’s hoodie protagonists but also their families (their higher-achieving female siblings being one of many passing nods to current sociological debates), to whom they have to make implausible excuses for staying out late. The mid-teenage gang members are viewed with suspicion by actual gangster Hi-Hatz but with admiration by nine-year-old wannabes Gavin and Reginald. ‘Mayhem’ and ‘Probs’, as they style themselves, have the excuse of extreme youth, whereas affluent white dopehead Brewis’s attempts at blending in (‘primatology, mammatology, all that shizzle’) attract derision from everybody except his dealer Ron (Nick Frost), who would regard even the outbreak of World War III with amiably befuddled equanimity.

Cornish draws superb performances out of his inexperienced central quintet, especially John Boyega (taciturn Moses) and Alex Esmail (livewire Pest). Their knifepoint mugging of trainee nurse Sam (Jodie Whittaker) risks audience alienation at the start, but likeable personalities quickly assert themselves with the aid of pungently witty dialogue (which Cornish developed with the cast and extensive pre-production research in local youth clubs) and the unsurprising revelation that their apparent menace is based more on bravado than being genuine hard cases like Hi-Hatz. But there’s also justified resentment about the cards dealt them in life, expressed generally through a longstanding (and mutual) hatred of the police, and directly through Moses’s paranoid speculation that the alien invasion might have been government-sanctioned as part of a plan to wipe out London’s Black population.

In common with its models, the film favours old-fashioned mechanical special effects to create the ‘big alien gorilla-wolf motherfuckers’ around whose invasion the plot revolves. These inspired combinations of shaggy black fur, glowing green fangs and lolloping gait are simultaneously menacing and strangely beautiful, especially in a slow-motion shot of a group of them chasing a sword-wielding Moses down a corridor. Cinematographer Tom Townend turns exclusively nocturnal locations into a riot of neon-drenched colour reminiscent of Andrew Laszlo’s work for Walter Hill, while the electronic throb of Steven Price’s score betrays an unmistakable John Carpenter influence.

Films this cine-literate are rarely this unpretentiously enjoyable, but it’s easy to see why it brought the house down at its South by Southwest festival premiere – even with people who struggled with some heroically uncompromising accents.

**Dr Clive Chijioke Nwonka (host)** is Associate Professor in Film, Culture and Society at UCL, and a Faculty Associate of the UCL Sarah Parker Remond Centre for the Study of Racism and Racialisation. Dr Nwonka’s research centres on the study of Black British and African American film, with a particular focus on the Black aesthetics, images of Black urbanity and the modes through which Black identities are shaped within forms of Black popular culture. Nwonka is the author of the book _Black Boys: The Social Aesthetics of British Urban Film_ (2023), the co-editor of the book _Black Film/British Cinema II_ (2021) and is the author of the forthcoming _Black Arsenal: Race, Cultural Memory and Black British Identity_ (2024).

**Michael Ajao** is an actor/voiceover artist/writer from South London. He broke into the industry when he made his debut in the film _Attack the Block_, directed by Joe Cornish, at the tender age of 12. Since then he has made numerous appearances on stage, TV and film. His latest appearance was in the critically acclaimed Edgar Wright film _Last Night in Soho_, which you can now stream on Netflix.

**Jumayn Hunter** is a British actor known for martial arts, a big energetic personality, and cerebral performances in both cult film and mainstream blockbusters. His childhood, spent experiencing a unique blend of cultures in Florida, Jamaica, Paris and more, built the foundation for an acting career early on, with his debut being in theatre in the play _Afterbirth_ by Deborah Paige, quickly followed by _Macbeth_ by Max Stafford Clark. JR broke into mainstream television with _The Bill_ and _Casualty_ and had his feature film debut with _Fallout_, which launched his love for acting and solidified a career. Performances in _Eden Lake_, _Cherry Tree Lane_, _Attack the Block_, _Piggy_ and _Quartet_ followed soon after.

His skilful portrayal of complex characters led to notable collaborations with Idris Elba in _Guerrilla_ and _Yardie_, and Steve McQueen in his _Small Axe_ project. Showing his ability to seamlessly move between genres, he’s been seen in indie sci-fi _How to Talk to Girls at Parties_ with Nicole Kidman, and in mainstream comedy with Sarah Pascoe’s _Out of Her Mind_. With a wealth of experience under his belt, he’s now planning his own projects; working with the likes of Netflix, BBC, SKY, Far Eastern, Continental African and South American and Bollywood cinema, he is hoping to produce some truly unique and polarising cinema for the future.
