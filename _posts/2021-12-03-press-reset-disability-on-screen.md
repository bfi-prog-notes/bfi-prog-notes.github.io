Tackling the damaging impacts of Ableism, Press Reset aims to inspire decision makers in film and TV to reset their practices to establish a new normal for people with disabilities working in front of and behind the camera.

With pre-recorded keynote by Andrew Miller MBE.  

**Disability On Screen: Past, Present and Future<br>  
A film by Daisy Powell**

Daisy joined the School of English at the University of Leeds in October 2019 as a postgraduate researcher. Her PhD explores depictions of disability, class and resistance in contemporary austerity Britain, with a focus on 21st century literature and film. It is funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council through the White Rose College of the Arts & Humanities (WRoCAH).

Daisy holds a Master of Arts by Research also from the University of Leeds, titled _Challenging Ableist Perceptions of Disability and Cure Through Contemporary Cultural Narratives._

Between 2014 and 2019 she worked for the charities Nordoff Robbins Music Therapy and Centre for Ageing Better and Lifelites, delivering arts and technology projects designed for disabled people of all ages.

_Disability On Screen: Past, Present and Future_  explores the history of ableism in British film and television, revealing the socio-political implications of misrepresentation and the ongoing practice of ‘cripping up’. In conversation with actors, presenters and filmmakers, it considers what progress has been made, what still needs to be addressed and how this can be achieved.
