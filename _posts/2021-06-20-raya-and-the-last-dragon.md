**What’s it about?**

Disney’s latest stunning animated feature follows Raya, a warrior from Kumandra, a realm of warring nations divided by mistrust. When the bickering tribes break a magical orb and unleash an evil power that turns people to stone, Raya begins an epic quest to find the last dragon, reunite the missing pieces and right the wrongs of the past.<br>
**‘The world’s broken. You can’t trust anyone.’ _— Raya_**,br>

**‘Maybe it’s broken because you don’t trust anyone.’ _— Sisu_**<br>

From Walt Disney Animation Studios comes the epic adventure _Raya and the Last Dragon_, set in the fantasy world of Kumandra, where long ago  humans and dragons lived together in harmony.  
But when an evil force  threatened the land, the dragons sacrificed themselves to save humanity.

Now, 500 years later, that same evil has returned and it’s up to a lone warrior, Raya, to track down the legendary last dragon to restore the fractured land and unite its divided people.

‘Everything’s been taken away from Raya,’ explains producer Osnat Shurer. ‘She’s totally on her own. She’s got nothing left save for her father’s sword, her friend, Tuk Tuk, and a shard of something that might be magical. And she sets out into Kumandra seeking the last dragon, Sisu, with the hope of restoring peace to her land.’

But along her journey, Raya will learn that it’ll take more than a dragon to save the world. ‘This is Raya’s journey of learning to trust,’ says director Don Hall, ‘after her trust was so deeply broken when she was a child.’

‘You can’t really get to unity without trust, and for Raya it will take trusting a group of strangers if she is ever going to have a united Kumandra,’ adds Carlos López Estrada, who shares directing duties with Don Hall.

Raya’s quest to find the last dragon, destroy the Druun and save her world is also a journey of self-discovery – a quest filled with danger, adventure, humor and new friendships, yet tinged with regret, loss and anger born of the need to avenge a wrong. What Raya learns, and comes to believe, is bigger than all of us: we can trust, wecan work together, we can unite. And, most importantly, we must.<br>
