_+ intro and discussion_

The ruins of the former Spiders Web Castle emerge from the mist for the second relaxed screening in our Kurosawa season. But why exactly has the castle met such a fate and what happened to its ruler? We look at Kurosawa’s tempestuous adaptation of _Macbeth_.

Selected and hosted by campaigner and  
creative Leo Capella.

**RELAXED SERIES:  
KUROSAWA: HONOUR, MIFUNE AND BETRAYAL**

As part of our Akira Kurosawa season in January and February we present two relaxed screenings which show core themes of honour and betrayal from in his work in very different ways.

Both films feature the legendary actor Toshiro Mifune with whom Kurosawa had a defining partnership in two different roles: wise rebel general and tragic war-hero turned villain. Both films also explore similar themes of honour amongst people and betrayal in different ways, whether through comic double crossing comedy or intense character driven tragedy.

The screenings have been selected by campaigner and creative Leo Capella (former Autism Access Specialist at the National Autistic Society). He will introduce each screening.

After each screening join us for a relaxed discussion in the Blue Room as we explore some of these themes. Leo Capella will host the discussion in conversation with Kurosawa season co-programmer, Ian Haydn-Smith.
