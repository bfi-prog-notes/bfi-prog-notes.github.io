_+ intro and discussion_

The ruins of the former Spiders Web Castle emerge from the mist for the second relaxed screening in our Kurosawa season. But why exactly has the castle met such a fate and what happened to its ruler? We look at Kurosawaâ€™s tempestuous adaptation of _Macbeth_.

Selected and hosted by campaigner and  
creative Leo Capella.
