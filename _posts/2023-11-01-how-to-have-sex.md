_+ Q&A with director Molly Manning Walker and actor Mia McKenna-Bruce_

Tara is 16 and heading to the Cretan coastal town of Malia with her best friends Skye and Em. They’ve finished their exams and are all set for a rites-of-passage holiday full of boozing, clubbing and hooking up. For Tara, the trip holds extra importance – she is desperate to lose her virginity before they head home. Staying in the apartment across from the girls is a group of lads. Amongst them, Tara identifies a couple of potential candidates… Manning Walker accurately captures the giddy freedom of a coming-of-age summer, and a very distinct British youth culture. However, among the buzz and nostalgia, she unpacks some the joys and horrors of the teenage-girl experience. Mia McKenna-Bruce (_The Dumping Ground_), is sensational as Tara, her facial expressions telling us all as Tara’s holiday becomes formative, but not in the way she wished for.

**Origins and development of ‘How to Have Sex’**  
_How To Have Sex_ took Molly Manning Walker by surprise. After training as a DOP at the National Film and Television school, going on to lens work across TV and commercials including the TV mini-series 2021’s _Mood_ and the 2023 World Cinematic Grand Jury Prize winner at Sundance, _Scrapper,_ Walker knew it was time to take on her feature debut.

After her first short film _Good Thanks, You?_ was selected to play in the 2020 Critics’ Week sidebar in Cannes, Film4 offered the filmmaker the chance to write a treatment for consideration.

Inspiration came to Walker at a wedding, surrounded by school friends and reminiscing about a party holiday at a Mediterranean resort: a rite-of-passage vacation British teenagers yearn for, a spiritual sibling to a spring break, albeit – deliberately – tackier, sweatier, grimier, and, if possible, even more sexually uninhibited. Walker thought she had imagined some of the events of that one girls trip – ‘I was talking about a blow job that had happened on stage at a club, half convinced I must have imagined it, but everyone remembered it the same way.’

This gave Walker the beating heart she needed to write the story. ‘I hadn’t realised how much sexual influence it had had on my life, but also on everyone I spoke to at that wedding,’ Walker says, these party holidays ‘are worlds built around sexual pressure, which is such a strange thing.’

What started as a treatment snowballed into 58 pages – once Walker cracked open those memories, the story of these girls, girls we’ve either been or known, just flowed. All the writer and director had to do was follow its path. Film4 agreed. Walker used photos as her compass, recalling the world of garish resorts – like Malia, Magaluf, Ibiza – and über-cheap nightclubs bunched together on one single road akin to an adult Disneyland and dubbed the ‘strip’.

Ivana MacKinnon and Emily Leo from Wild Swim joined Walker on _How To Have Sex_ in the development stages, absorbed by the energy of her writing and the psychic proximity to these young girls. ‘Molly had created a deceptively simple world and a story, but which touched on huge, very complex questions that can be difficult to speak about.’

_How To Have Sex_ was accepted into the Cannes Next Step 7th Session workshop, run by Semaine de la Critique, which is when the penny dropped: thanks to Cannes, and the symbolic timeline between her successful short film and upcoming feature, Molly Manning Walker knew her film was finally going to get made.

_Good Thanks, You?_ charts the aftermath of a rape, and gave Walker the tools to explore what happens next – how the conversation about sexual assault is often choked by silence, with consent misunderstood and manipulated at all ages. ‘People are suffocated by the subject,’ Walker says. ‘I’ve been affected directly by this, and I feel passionate about it – I didn’t feel I was finished talking about it.’

Walker hoped that the conversation and attitudes might have evolved in the years since her girls’ holidays, but the filmmaker had to know whether that hope bore out. The director and her team conducted focus groups across the UK, focusing on key cities including Manchester, Nottingham and London to map how young people feel about sex today.

The young people Walker and her team spoke to were separated into male and female groups and invited to read parts of the script for _How To Have Sex_ and share feedback. ‘They would read the first assault scene and be like, “Oh, this isn’t assault”, and at one point a girl even said, “Girls need to take responsibility, and not get so drunk.” So at the end, we were even more sure this was an important film to make,’ says Walker.

Leo was shocked when a number of the girls and boys started talking about their own assaults, ‘sometimes for the first time, because there was a safe space in which to do so – and because they could see it was a shared experience.’ Making the film became about capturing the ‘subtlety of the social pressures around sex’, admitting ourselves ‘a product of that environment’ and finding a path forward with new solutions for the next generation to feel less alone.
