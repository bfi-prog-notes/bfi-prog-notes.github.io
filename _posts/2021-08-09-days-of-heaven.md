Despite being second choice after guitarist Leo Kottke opted to write songs rather than the entire score, Morricone received his first Oscar nomination for Terrence Malick’s elegiac tale of the Texas Panhandle in the mid-1910s.  
In many ways, the rustic themes make this the flipside of a compositional coin with his work on Bernardo Bertolucci’s _1900_ (1976). The ghost of Giuseppe Verdi haunts that epic account of Italy’s descent into fascism, but it’s the  
7th movement of Camille Saint-Saëns’s _Carnival of the Animals_, that inspired Morricone’s pastoral theme, ‘Aquarium’. It’s complemented by the equally enchanting string serenade, ‘Harvest’; the deft flute piece, ‘Happiness’; and a love theme that contains echoes of the score that Vincent Ward would reject for _What Dreams May Come_ (1998).

By contrast, there’s dramatic urgency in ‘The Fire’, which swirls around the locust swarm and the billowing blaze. All of which leaves you wondering why Malick kept feeling the need to interfere with the maestro’s process.

**A contemporary review**  
At the risk of being accused of repeating himself, Terrence Malick has here virtually re-orchestrated (though with incomparably greater richness) the principal features of _Badlands_, using an oblique voice-off commentary to distantiate and lend poetic dimensions to the otherwise fairly banal story of young fugitives fleeing from the intolerable frustrations of society. Where _Badlands_ was about the unilateral influence of untamed landscapes on two young urban delinquents, _Days of Heaven_ widens its perspective to describe no less than mankind, the Earth, and their mutual interaction.

Following a black-and-white montage of photographs summing up the legacy of the industrial revolution, two images perfectly describe the totality of the urban inferno: outside, under a bleak sky, women drudge through a mountain of slag in quest of fragments of coal; inside, roasted by hellish flames, men toil like robots to keep the furnaces alive. Then, seen silhouetted against the skyline with people clinging to every inch of its surface, the train looms as a Noah’s ark heading for the promise of a new world, seemingly fulfilled as the paradise of the Texan wheat fields begin to stretch away, golden and lazily waving, as far as the eye can see. ‘All three of us been going places, looking for things, searching for things, going on adventures,’ Linda’s commentary had cheerfully started, almost immediately introducing a note of apocalypse as she describes the forebodings of a stranger on the train. ‘He told me the whole earth was going up in flames ... There’s gonna be creatures running every which way, some of them burned, half their wings burning. People are gonna be screamin’ and hollerin’ for help ...’

Lush and pastoral, with herds of bison tranquilly grazing within reach of the harvesters, the Texan wheat fields seem to deny this vision as absurd.  
Yet already the farmer’s stately mansion, perched in solitary splendour on the skyline in echo of _Giant_ and apparently devoid of human inhabitants, looms as a House of Usher doomed to fall under the weight of human loneliness and folly. Already steam engines are rumbling in, shaking the earth as they haul in the machinery to make the harvesting easier, quicker, more profitable. Already the animals are cowering in fear as their domain is invaded. And as the harvest reaches its frenzied climax, one shot of a mechanical separator belching choking clouds of chaff and grain into the parched atmosphere is enough to signal the parallel (unnecessarily stressed by a flash cut-in) with the furnaces of Chicago. This, one might say, is the thesis of the film, echoed by Bill’s Horatio Algerish rather than socialistic determination to wage his own war on poverty: ‘We got to do something about it; can’t expect anybody else to.’

At which point the film turns the thesis inside out in acknowledgment of the follies and frailties of the human heart. Unexpectedly, the phoney marriage turns into a true one; equally unexpectedly, the hungry intruders on wealth react with grace rather than with acquisitive greed; and against all odds, the quartet are forged momentarily into a tight family unit, imperfect only because the initial lie means that Bill can neither remain nor bow out without destroying it. Almost achieved here, but disrupted from within, is the utopic balance that Linda reaches for in her attempt to explain Bill’s motivation: ‘He figured some people need more than they got, other people got more than they need.’  Man, in other words, is turning in a vicious circle, destroying his earth in quest of the profit by which he is incapable of profiting.

The title of the film, given the extraordinary minatory power with which Malick invests his images of landscapes and objects – wind angrily ruffling a field of wheat, a scarecrow standing baleful guard by night, a glass preserving its taint of infidelity at the bottom of a river – seems to refer less to the numbered days of heaven enjoyed by the quartet on the farm, than to a time when gods once walked the earth where now only frail and fallible men persist in their illogical lives and unfathomable drives. Having destroyed their world, they are now dying along with it, purged from its face by the plagues of fire and locusts; and what is perhaps the key image in the film comes when, soon after embarking on his final flight, arriving at a river crossing, Bill is seen in enigmatic long shot holding out a medallion necklace to the ferryman. Obviously trading for a boat, he is also paying Charon prior to crossing the Styx; and as the boat pursues its ghostly voyage down the river, what we see are tranquil images of people going peacefully about their business, but what we hear is Linda’s attempt to explain these visions: ‘And you could see people on the shore, but it was far off and you couldn’t see what they were doing. They were probably callin’ for help or somethin’, or they were tryin’ to bury somebody or somethin’. Some sights that I saw was really spooky, that it gave me goose pimples, and that I felt like cold hands touchin’ the back of my neck and ... it could be the dead comin’ for me or somethin’.’

Having conjured the old Eden on its last legs, its course of self-destruction hastened by the industrial revolution, Malick then leaves it to die on the battlefields of the First World War. After that a new world began, with new and hitherto undreamed of forms of self-annihilation...
