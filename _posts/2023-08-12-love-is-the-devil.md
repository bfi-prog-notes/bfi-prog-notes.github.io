When _Love Is the Devil_ was released in 1998, it was John Maybury’s first incursion into the mainstream after a long career stretching back to his teens when he worked on Derek Jarman’s celebrated film _Jubilee_ (1978) in the British film avant-garde (though Maybury preferred the term ‘underground cinema’). In the early 1980s and working on no budgets Maybury – together with artist and filmmaker Cerith Wyn Evans – spearheaded the last coherent British avant-garde film movement, dubbed the New Romantics (much to the chagrin of the filmmakers themselves). With their use of the amateur Super 8 film gauge, they developed an intensely imagistic aesthetic often combining symbolist motifs with sexual (primarily gay) excess and an inter-textuality in which pop, classical and world music, dance, text and fashion freely intermingled. In this way, the New Romantics broke with the modernist formalism that had dominated the avant-garde since the late 1960s.

Godard, Cocteau, Warhol and Kenneth Anger among others were obvious reference points for Maybury, who in his dynamic and hypnotic short film _Tortures that Laugh_ (1983), shot on black and white 16mm, depicted a dark claustrophobic world in which personal isolation was endemic (a view that seems to have informed all of his work since including _Love Is the Devil_ and the more recent _The Jacket_, 2005). In a long video piece _Circus Logic I-IV_ (1983) he collaged found imagery taken from films, television, newspapers and magazines, and at times the voice of William S. Burroughs, to explore popular culture and its stifling effects on personal and sexual freedom. Maybury’s worldview seems one of social and psychological fragmentation and superficiality, which made his work quite distinctive within the movement, and still informs his filmmaking.

By the mid 1980s Maybury was an adept and keen experimenter with the new technologies of video and early computerisation. He also became more involved in pop videos, working with Boy George, Neneh Cherry and Sinéad O’Connor and contributing to Jarman’s films and videos, notably The Smith’s ‘The Queen Is Dead’. Ironically, his most successful pop video – for O’Connor’s hit ‘Nothing Compares 2 U’ (1990) – used only a very simple Warholian long take, focussing on O’Connor’s moving performance. It scooped MTV and Grammy awards and became a classic of the genre.

Even at this early stage in his career Maybury showed a willingness and ability to shape his work to the material at hand and not to be ruled by any single aesthetic or technological practice. In the years that followed, particularly in the early 1990s, he was an early enthusiast for the burgeoning video/digital-effects world, using such techniques in his hour-long films _Premonition of Absurd Perversion in Sexual Personae Part 1_ (1992) and _Remembrance of Things Fast_ (1993). In both these films a frantic approach dominated by special effects often overwhelmed any theme, though the case here was often that of the medium being the message: media proliferation and its disjunctive chaotic invasion of society seemed to reflect the mental breakdown of characters, who in _Remembrance_ speak directly to camera. In retrospect it is clear how much importance Maybury gave to performance. For example in 1992 he made _Man to Man_, based on the one-woman play of the same name by Manfred Karge with Tilda Swinton in the single role, of a German woman who disguises herself as a man during and after World War II.

But in most ways _Love Is the Devil_ marked a fundamental break. First, Maybury had a decent budget. Second, the fragmented excess of preceding films gave way to a cool, detached control with priority given to the performances, notably those of Derek Jacobi as Francis Bacon and Daniel Craig as his lover George Dyer. A BBC co-funded film, it was loosely based on Daniel Farson’s biography of Bacon. The estate did not allow any reproduction of Bacon’s paintings in the film, which turned out to be a blessing in disguise for Maybury, who was able to focus on what interested him about Bacon, namely his relationship with George Dyer, a petty East London thief. It is a remarkably confident first feature film in its handling of the narrative and in its excellent performances.

The film begins ‘at the end’ with Dyer’s suicide by an overdose in a Paris hotel as Bacon attends the opening night of his major 1971 retrospective at the Grand Palais. What follows is the story of two men locked into a relationship from which neither can escape. Seeing the film again, not only has it not dated, but it can be seen as a film that offers much more than the usual artist biog. It achieves a quite stunning psychological depth in its portrait of a tragic love affair. Despite some awkwardness in the script it is clear to see why Steven Soderbergh admired the film and how it became Maybury’s calling card to Hollywood.

A complex film, dealing with sex, art, class, love and neurosis, _Love Is the Devil_ works in many ways on dualities and ironic reversals. Bacon’s sexual masochism – with Dyer dishing out the sadism with belted fist – is reversed in their social relationship in which it is Bacon’s confidence, sophistication and wit that cruelly dominates the uneducated working class thief, enthralled by his famous lover. While Bacon can relish working-class culture – shown in a visit to an East London boxing match – Dyer is lost in Bacon’s camp bohemian Soho world of writers and artists. In matters of love, it is Dyer who falls victim to a crushing dependency on Bacon as he mentally disintegrates and becomes addicted to drugs and drink, while Bacon grows weary of him. Bacon also recognises his own inability to love, revealing a deep isolation and coldness to his character that is relieved only by his paintings, which alone bear witness to his deeper emotional states, and that seem to reflect Dyer’s inner turmoil and nightmares. It is this paradox that drives the film and places its achievement as a depiction of the artistic attitude and process alongside Jarman’s _Caravaggio_.

Maybury’s long-standing interest in the overlapping aspects of British culture found a fascinating outlet in _Love Is the Devil_. Visits to the different worlds of the British Museum, the boxing match, the Colony Room Club are all absorbed into Bacon’s world where aesthetics and sex rule, whereas for Dyer there is only confusion. If Bacon can produce art from this fragmentary experience, then Dyer can only drown in its contradictions. For both men, in the end, love is an unattainable state, forever out of reach. While Bacon can artistically thrive on this, Dyer’s mental life implodes, leading to his suicide. Maybury makes this point with great visual economy in a memorable shot of Bacon working in his studio at night with a drunken Dyer crumpled on the littered floor behind him.

Maybury had always been fascinated by subcultures and he seems to relish the scenes at the Colony Room, run by Tilda Swinton’s Muriel Belcher, whose obscene wit and ruthless purging of unwanted guests was notorious. Played with gusto, equalled by Karl Johnson’s seedy and more laid-back _Vogue_ photographer John Deakin, they are the film’s Greek chorus, gathered around Bacon, and revelling in his fame and outrageous wit and charm. For Dyer, it is an alien world in which he is tolerated and patronised. Finally, Dyer can exist neither in his old world of the London working-class criminal nor in this new one revolving around his lover. But Maybury draws out a very sympathetic performance from Jacobi as Bacon, who in many ways is the villain of the film, and Craig’s Dyer achieves a wonderful balance of a tough man struggling with his inner demons. A remarkable film.
