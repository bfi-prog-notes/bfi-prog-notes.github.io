**Hassen Ferhani on ‘143 Sahara Street’**

_How does one meet a character as singular as Malika?_

After having made _Roundabout in My Head_, I wanted to hit the road, to cross landscapes and have the encounters that go with it, but also with the idea of making a road movie, an always fascinating movie genre. I hit the road many times, heading South especially, to find places, characters, stories… During one of these trips, I was joined by Chawki Amari, a writer friend of mine who is also a press columnist and an occasional actor. We made a long crossing that took us from Algiers to the Highlands, then to Ain Sefra and on to a good part of south-western Algeria. We headed towards the centre of the Sahara to join Route One which connects Algiers to Tamanrasset. _Route One_ is also the title of one of Chawki’s books, a travelogue in the form of a novel. At the time, I did not know if his characters were real or not. For me, Malika came under the rubric of ‘literary fantasies’.

_You did not expect such an intense encounter?_

I already knew that Amari had identified interesting characters for his book but was far from imagining how interesting Malika could be, especially from a cinematographic point of view. As soon as I walked into her place, I knew that’s where my movie was. The idea came to me that, here, we could do an inverted road movie.

A paradoxical idea in appearance, because after all, what is a road movie if not a film that happens on the road? Here we were in a place on the road that exists because of the road and for the road the truckers. I loved this simple place that housed so many things, in addition to the charisma and strength of this woman, who is there in the middle of nowhere. It is incredible what can be said and can occur within a 20 square meter space and in one of the largest deserts in  
the world.

_In the middle of nowhere, as you say…_

I used this expression but would like to replace it by ‘in the middle of everywhere.’ It’s more accurate to say it like that because, contrary to popular belief, the Sahara is not a deserted place. It’s immense, it seems very empty but it’s not the case. People live there, work there, and travel there. There is so much going on there. Also, I was able to realise that Malika’s truck stop is practically on the geographical centre of Algeria. Places that have atmospheres of their own and that bring together people from all over the country, that’s what I’m looking for in my cinema. Here we have those who go down to Tamanrasset in the extreme South or up to Algiers in the far North. After this encounter I called my producer to inform her that I was changing course.

_In addition to being a paradoxical road movie,_ 143 Sahara Street _can also seem like a paradoxical ‘in camera’ movie? We are in a fixed and specific place that we discover through its hostess and guests who reveal to us all the extent of the outside world, like an immense and permanent out-of-camera range._

Things could be  presented that way, that is to say an ‘in camera’ opened onto Algeria  and the world. I am always looking for meaningful and expressive  places that are capable of hinting at everything that surrounds us far  beyond their own space. I follow this approach in the way I choose  place and subject but also in the way I film.

_This way is already present in your first feature film_ A Roundabout in My Head…

When I was younger, a phrase by Robert Bresson left a mark on me: ‘I’m looking for the shot that will tell about all the other shots.’ I have it in mind every time I set up my camera. I have the same approach during scouting. Here, I try to theorise what concerns the realm of experience because the encounter is something that cannot be explained. Like in this case, where this incredible woman who has decided to write her Story in this place, who has left Northern Algeria to settle down where there were only stones, sand, unbearable heat, alone and more than 50 kilometres away from the next house, with her dog and cat. She has created this place and I often imagine that, in half a century perhaps – to use the usual clichés – a small town will grow here, a kind of Malikatown of the Algerian Far South. Everyone knows Malika hundreds of kilometres around, she knows all the truckers, their journeys, their stories… She is this place! Malika’s choice had to do with intuition, something that is way beyond us.

_But even by intuition, we can follow a process. For example, in your previous film and this one too, we are dealing with people who work hard. Is this a common thread in your film world?_

Someone told me once ‘you are  filming the margins of society.’ I said no, I do not film the margins  but the heart of society. I film my peers. For me, the important  thing is that these people are carriers of poetry. In a direct or  indirect way, a conscious or unconscious way, there is a sort of  poetry in them. When Malika looks at the road all day long, there  is poetry there, like when she comments on what is happening in  front of her, from this place that is her centre of the world. Finally,  that’s what I filmed: this place that became the centre of the world  through Malika’s eyes.

_Can we say that beyond society and history, beyond poetry too, you have a philosophical look at your characters, just as they sometimes ask themselves philosophical questions?_

In high school, I was very bad  at this subject! In any case, when people watch my films, these  are things that can appear to them. But I’m not looking for  philosophy. I am carried by something that is akin to popular  wisdom and, where we come from, it is incomparably rich. My  films show the diversity of Algerians. Overseas but also in Algeria,  there is a tendency to reduce Algerians to a monolithic vision.What I like about my characters is that they can have multiple  colourings to them and that they compose their own colours.

_To me, two elements seem to characterise your approach: a long preparation to identify your places and characters but also for you to soak them in and make them accept you, and then very light logistics at human and material level._

For the first point, it’s both  right and wrong. I am one of the directors who do very little  scouting. I spend a lot of time to find a subject and a place,  but once it’s decided, I don’t linger. For me, scouting continues  during the shooting, filming is also scouting. Once I get the  agreement of the person or persons I’m going to film, I settle in  and start. For the team, it’s a staging choice. When there is only  two of us, confidence settles in naturally. I am also the director  of photography for my films and I cannot imagine leaving the camera work to another because it’s my writing tool.

_You’re often invited to move on to fiction. Does this touch you?_

To tell you the truth, I do not really like the  designation ‘documentary film.’  
I’m thrilled when my films are  selected for festivals that do not affirm a particular genre. This  compartmentalisation tends to disappear, I hope. Finally, the  difference between a fiction film and a documentary is the work  they are based on. In the first case there is a scenario written in  advance and in the second, the scenario is written while shooting  the film. In any case that’s the way I work, I write while shooting. In documentary  film, the matter of what is real determines the story. I work on what is alive,  which ultimately carries more fiction. With _143 Sahara Street_ the story sweeps  through many aspects of Algerian society. This was also found in your previous  film whose title is becoming a popular expression. Are there any prefigurations  or intuitions of what is happening in Algeria at the moment? I won’t look for  archetypes. I am not into a sociological approach. First and foremost, I try to  do cinema. As for what is happening in Algeria today, it is inevitably something  that was already stirring our entire society but was a bit buried. If we portray  accurately a place or a character, it can become a microcosm that reveals  an entire society or country. So yes, there were signs that are easier to spot  afterwards. But I did not try to reveal them and everyone is free to interpret the  film as they see fit.<br>
