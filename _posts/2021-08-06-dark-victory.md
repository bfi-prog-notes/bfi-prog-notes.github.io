**SPOILER WARNING  The following notes give away some of the plot.**

A Long Island socialite (Davis) who lives life to the full is unaware of an unwelcome medical diagnosis while becoming close to the doctor (George Brent) who is treating her. This unashamedly melodramatic tear jerker sees Davis brilliantly navigating a role that requires multiple layers and a commitment to the genre, and it saw her rewarded with another Oscar® nomination, securing her status as one of Hollywood’s leading talents.

**Contemporary reviews**

Last quarter I had the rare treat of seeing two Bette Davis films. I say I, and not we, because I believe it to be true that Bette Davis is not everyone’s choice, but that does not shake my conviction that she is the greatest, the only actress in the cinema. And indeed after seeing those two films, _Dark Victory_ and _Juarez_, my conviction is stronger than ever.

The essence of acting on the films, as opposed to appearing on them, lies in the ability to communicate to an audience what a character is thinking and feeling. The feeling is comparatively easy, once the control of facial expression has been mastered. Garbo has an unfailing camera instinct in this respect; she always looks right without the least difficulty, but she never seems to be thinking beyond the immediate moment. With Bette Davis one is always two jumps ahead with her of her dialogue. Every shot is a build-up for the next one, so that when her part is finished, her characterisation has the inevitability of completeness. She lives her characters rather than acts them. There is no one else in films today who can quite do that. No one who can so successfully overcome the technical but unavoidable disadvantage of building up a character in scenes that are not consecutive in the story. Muni, Tracy, Laughton, Rainer, Bergner and the rest can be relied upon to act any scene without fault, but when the director says ‘cut’ the performance is finished and complete; everything has been said and done, the thought current is switched off instead of being left on to illuminate the next shot.

But to return to criticism. _Dark Victory_ was all about a young high-spirited girl who suffered from dizzy spells and refused to see a doctor, partly from fear, partly from obstinacy. When she is finally persuaded to see Doctor George Brent we learn that she has an incurable brain disease. An operation is performed which gives temporary relief, but her days are numbered and sudden death will come within a very short time. On such a medical foundation is the story built and it is never a particularly convincing one. But Bette Davis forces one to swallow it all, and when death does come to put an end to a life that has been pitifully misspent and all too briefly atoned for, one is genuinely moved, such is the persuasiveness of her acting. But, unfortunately, we are rudely reminded by a sentimental anti-climax that it is, after all, a highly melodramatic piece of hokum that we have been watching.  
**Alan Page, _Sight & Sound_, Summer 1939**

The story is high-pitched melodrama and there is a stupid anti-climax. But it is well directed and holds the interest. Bette Davis, as Judith, has a real actress’s part with every kind of opportunity. The power and artistry of her performance are of a dazzling brilliance. She creates a character that surmounts all the improbabilities of the story; in short, a very great piece of acting. George Brent is excellent as the understanding Steele and Geraldine Fitzgerald, as  
Bette Davis’s friend, contrives not to be entirely out-acted by the star.
