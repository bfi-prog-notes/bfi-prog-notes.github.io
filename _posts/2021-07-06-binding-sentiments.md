**SPOILER WARNING  The following notes give away some of the plot.**

From the opening ‘Scope tracking shot across the airfield it’s clear that this is a film about observation. Kati Kovács plays the fiancée sent to control her future mother-in-law, but whose moral compass ultimately subverts patriarchal intentions. Mészáros’ recurring themes exploring the generation gap and traditional family structures sit at the centre of this often humorous game of cat-and-mouse.<br>

Although she favours the squarish Academy frame, in her second feature _Binding Sentiments_ (1969) Márta Mészáros used anamorphic widescreen to tell a story initially set in claustrophobic interiors. The recently bereaved Edit (Mari Töröcsik, one of Hungary’s biggest stars) pays lip-service to social convention while making it clear to anyone prepared to pick up on numerous unmistakable (albeit often non-verbal) signals that she never particularly liked her husband and would much rather cut herself loose from the past, whatever her son István might prefer.<br>

Edit, a simple peasant girl who became the wife of a politician, suddenly becomes a widow as a result of an accident. She never loved her husband. She lives a wealthy and lonely life amidst false friends, facing one of the last alternatives of her life, i.e. having to face her past in the hope of an independent new beginning. Her sons do not even try to understand her. István, who is of the opposite political conviction than his father used to be but has the same autocratic personality, blames her intention to give up her life-insurance and luxurious apartment on hysteria. He has her watched by Kati, his fiancée, at their summer resort at Lake Balaton in order to prevent her from violating his father’s authority and destroying appearances.

‘It is clear in Mészáros’s films, that there are no women, who don’t pay, whether salaried or not. The heroine of _Binding Sentiments_, unusual among Mészáros’s heroines for not being a factory worker, is an older woman suddenly confronted with the implications of her life when her husband, a respected intellectual, dies. Her efforts to shed her role as a grieving but affluent widow are fought by her son, who literally holds her prisoner in an attempt to make her “see reason”, that is, to behave as a woman ought in patriarchal terms. The son’s girlfriend goes along with his plans until she becomes sickened by the role of jailer and leaves, and the film ends on an ambivalent note as we see a ring of young boys encircling, trapping two little girls, closing them in.’<br>
