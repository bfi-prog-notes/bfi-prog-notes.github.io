_+ intro and discussion._

This enigmatic sci-fi is set in an alternative reality where frequencies emitted by the human brain determine future outcomes. The very existence of free will is questioned as a handful of young people gradually realise that difference is a strength to be harnessed, rather than a weakness to be concealed.

_Frequencies_ is the opening feature in a series of three screenings in this strand (next ones in June and July) exploring difference and the sensory effects that nature, with its abundance of ambient sights and sounds, can have upon both body and mind.

Please join us for an informal discussion in the Blue Room after the screening.<br>
