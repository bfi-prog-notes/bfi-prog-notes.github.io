_+ intro and discussion._

This enigmatic sci-fi is set in an alternative reality where frequencies emitted by the human brain determine future outcomes. The very existence of free will is questioned as a handful of young people gradually realise that difference is a strength to be harnessed, rather than a weakness to be concealed.

_Frequencies_ is the opening feature in a series of three screenings in this strand (next ones in June and July) exploring difference and the sensory effects that nature, with its abundance of ambient sights and sounds, can have upon both body and mind.

Please join us for an informal discussion in the Blue Room after the screening.

**Relaxed Screenings**

Relaxed screenings are presented each month for  
those in the neurodiverse community, their assistants and carers.

- Customers can select their seats when they arrive in the auditorium. You may sit with your family/friendship group or there are some single seats if you prefer.

- Please leave space between yourself and other groups and retain your selected seats for the duration of the performance if possible.
