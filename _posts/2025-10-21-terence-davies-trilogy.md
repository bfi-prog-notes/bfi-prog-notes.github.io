In 1977, as new students at the National Film School, the first thing we had to do was watch one another’s films. The slight, diffident and very polite man sitting next to me appeared to be doubled-up with shyness and apprehension. Oh dear, I thought, I bet he has made a tentative film. A few moments later **Children** (for my fellow student was Terence Davies) slammed out of the screen with such power, intensity and passion that no one at the school could see Terence in the same way again.

Shot in stark black and white, with uncompromising honesty, the only films I had seen that were at all similar were Bill Douglas’ trilogy _My Childhood_, _My Ain Folk_ and _My Way Home_. _Children_ – like the two earlier Douglas films – conveyed the pain and bewilderment of a powerless childhood and, as with Douglas, Davies had been discovered by the then head of the BFI Production Board, Mamoun Hassan. Terence wrote _Children_ while a mature student at drama school in Coventry, and sent the script off into the blue. Mamoun summoned Terence to London: ‘I shall give you £8,500 to make this film and not a penny more.’ ‘Who’s going to direct it?’ Terry asked. ‘You are,’ was the reply. Mamoun (who became one of our mentors at the school, and with whom we laughed so much at a screening of _Kind Hearts and Coronets_ that Terence fell off his stool) had recognised that the precision and intensity of the images in Terence’s writing revealed a potential film director of distinction.

A novice behind the camera (the eye-line match rule was a mystery to him), Terence wanted _Children_ to look like a Vermeer, and with this in mind he embarked on a collaboration with Bill Diver as lighting cameraman – a partnership which continued for the next five films, with Bill sometimes cutting, sometimes lighting and on _Distant Voices_ (with special union dispensation) doing both. Even then it was obvious that _Children_ was the work of a mature filmmaker and that his role at the film school was one of consolidating and refining his talent. While the rest of us were playing around trying to find our voice and talent, Terence moved immediately on to **Madonna and Child**. He was always clear that this film would form the second part of a trilogy. Thus, remarkably, _Madonna and Child_ was made as a student film. After watching a cut of _Madonna_ with visiting tutor Alexander Mackendrick I remember somebody asking him, ‘Is it a gay film?’ ‘It’s the least gay “gay” film I’ve ever seen,’ was the reply.

Certain moments in _Madonna and Child_ are possibly the bravest and most exceptional sequences to have been made at the film school. In particular the scenes set in a men’s lavatory, and the track across the church and around the stations of the cross which are accompanied by the voiceover of the tattooist, have immense power to shock, disturb and arouse compassion. The acting is exquisite and I cannot write of Terry Sullivan’s performance without my eyes filling with tears.

When Terence left the school, like most of us he had very little money, but he persevered in trying to make the third part of his trilogy. I think this final film, **Death and Transfiguration**, is the most remarkable achievement. The finance for the project was raised in dribs and drabs – Maureen McCue of Greater London Arts gave her entire minuscule film budget, and people worked on the project for the love of it. Wilfrid Brambell was persuaded to play the dying Robert Tucker, giving a moving, dignified performance. ‘Take your teeth out, Wilfrid,’ Terry asked, and, surprisingly and appropriately, Brambell did. With admirable tenacity and self-sacrifice Terence managed to shoot the film, with the BFI stepping in at the end like a good fairy to provide finishing costs and to distribute it.

I remember seeing a cut of _Death and Transfiguration_ and being stunned by the opening sequence – a wide-shot of the Liverpool sky, the radiator of Tucker’s mother’s hearse, Tucker’s hands folded quietly, the wheels of the funeral cars with their shining hub caps, Tucker’s grief-stricken face, the crematorium gates as the cortege drives in, the furnace doors closing on the coffin and its lonely wreath – the images cut to Doris Day singing ‘It All Depends on You’.

The trilogy did the rounds of the international festival circuits and was often seen – in the States in particular – as an unnecessarily pessimistic piece, receiving limited arthouse distribution as a result. In a ‘glad to be gay’ climate, the insecurity, guilt and downright loneliness so astutely expressed in these films was an unfashionable stance. Because Terence dared to show the pain of growing up Catholic and homosexual in working-class Liverpool in the ’50s and early ’60s, the films were not celebrated enough. Terence once told me that when he recognised his homosexuality he knelt in prayer for so long that his knees bled – this pain is conveyed in the spirit of his films.
