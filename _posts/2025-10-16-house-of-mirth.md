The screening at the [2018] BFI London Film Festival of Frank Borzage’s 1927 masterpiece _7th Heaven_ in a new restoration was cause for rejoicing. But Borzage, who directed movies from 1913 to the end of the 50s, sometimes seems in danger of shrinking down to just this one title, the way Dziga Vertov is often reduced to _Man with a Movie Camera_. At least this one does exemplify his crazed romantic vision.

Though Borzage made comedies, musicals and war movies, he’s known for his sentimental melodramas, which have a remarkable consistency of theme and approach. Like Hitchcock, he continued the approach of his silent movies into the sound era, using his angles and edits to tell stories pictorially and affect the audience emotionally without relying on dialogue. And in _Moonrise_ (1948), his last great work, he pulls off a rediscovery of the power of silent expressionism comparable to Charles Laughton’s _The Night of the Hunter_ (1955).
