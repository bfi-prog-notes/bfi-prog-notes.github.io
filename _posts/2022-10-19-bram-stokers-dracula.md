_+ intro by award-winning writer and broadcaster Christopher Frayling, in celebration of his upcoming book_ Vampire Cinema _(Wednesday 19 October only)_

Coppola’s version of Stoker’s novel – determinedly different from conventional vampire movies – revels in cinematic trickery and illusionism even as it turns up the feverish eroticism in Dracula’s relationship with Mina Harker, whom he believes is the reincarnation of his late wife. Oldman, in a part decidedly different from his customary realist roles, handles the fantasy and flamboyance with seductive aplomb.

Francis Ford Coppola and scriptwriter James V. Hart have, as the credit that opens the film, _Bram Stoker’s Dracula_, suggests, indeed gone back to Stoker. In terms of inclusion of incidents and characters, there is more left of the novel here than in any previous film versions with the possible exception of the 1970 Spanish _El Conde Dracula_ (Jesús Franco). To the now well-trod lines of Jonathan Harker’s visit to Transylvania and Dracula’s coming to England to wreak havoc on Harker’s friends and relatives are added elements that have only occasionally appeared in previous versions (the character of the Texan, Quincy P. Morris; the pursuit of Dracula back to Transylvania finally to ensnare him). The one substantial new element added to this, a prologue explaining how Vlad the Impaler became Dracula, gives a particular inflection to the story, but remains true to the project; it is well known that Vlad was an inspiration to Stoker.

Coppola’s Dracula flings itself at all this narrative material, emerging like a music video directed by Dario Argento. As in a video, narrativity comes at you in snatches, more a suggestion of connected incidents across a welter of vivid imagery than a fully presented plot. As in Argento’s _Suspiria_, say, or some other post-’60s horror movies like Sam Raimi’s _The Evil Dead_, narrative, and with it the pleasures of tease and suspense, are unimportant; it’s the maelstrom of sensation that matters. This means that the story may be hard to follow if you either haven’t read Stoker’s _Dracula_ or have a less than total recall of it (I remembered who Renfield and Quincey were, but it goes so fast that I had a hard time figuring out how and why at the end Mina gets to Transylvania before her menfolk).

As to the feeling, Coppola has certainly achieved something distinctive. Always one of cinema’s great colourists, he has here come up with a symphony in engulfing red and black. The prologue is shot in near-silhouette, black on red, setting the colour key signature for the film. Early sequences in Victorian England are anaemically coloured, gradually to be swallowed by red and black, vermillion and pitch, blood and the night. I am not the first to have reached for ‘engorgement’ as a word to describe the film. It’s not just the redness of the blood swelling the film’s climaxes, but the fullness of the image, bursting to the edge of the frame with thick colour and dense visual texture. Most remarkably, it’s in the vampires’ costuming, most voluminous when they are most needy. They look bloated with lust, and yet move then with greatest speed and ease, gliding not walking, as if motored by the desperate urgency of desire. When Lucy has become a vampire, she is dressed entirely in white, with bridal lace and fold upon fold of silk, and her face too is pale as death; yet her shrouded body rears up so turgidly, the lace ruffs round her neck are puffed like a monstrous lizard, even her cheeks seem fuller. Even without the red, she is the embodiment of engorgement.

The possibilities are endless, and Coppola and Hart know a good few of them. You want the attraction and terror of sexuality, the attraction of the terror of sexuality? Here it is, in Dracula’s metamorphosis from glowering bearded prince to cadaverous old goat to fin-de-siècle dandy, and in the wolf/ape thing that takes Lucy in the night. You want, more specifically, male fears of female sexuality? Here is the engorged, uncontrollable libidinous preference of Mina and Lucy for Gary Oldman’s dandy Dracula over Keanu Reeves’ sensitive but proper Jonathan. Or AIDS is a possibility, flung in here in a few lines ominously connecting sex, blood and disease. There’s even a vegetarian reading, in a cut that has the audience groaning as at a bad pun and which is borrowed from _The Hunger_, where Van Helsing’s dismemberment of Lucy’s head is followed straight on by him carving with relish into a side of rare beef.
