Tough-as-nails ex-mob moll Gloria lives alone with her cat, her gun and an endless supply of cigarettes, until she’s forced to go on the lam with a child in tow. Gena Rowlands’ energy and broad Bronx accent prove infectiously entertaining as she reluctantly drags her unlikely ward across New York in a blaze of gunfire. All of John Cassavetes’ signature character work and emotion are present in this explosive slice of genre filmmaking.

**A contemporary review**

There is a marvellous _coup de téâtre_ quite early on in _Gloria_ when Gena Rowlands dowdily ordinary and self-confessedly ‘overweight, out-of-shape’, is suddenly transformed into Humphrey Bogart in a placid little city square as she whips out her gun and coolly empties it into a carload of startled hoods. Utterly unprepared for in the characterisation, the moment is nevertheless implicit from the outset as the camera embarks on a stately helicopter journey across the nocturnal New York skyline to zero in on the Bronx in the daytime, just as a girl (the Puerto Rican wife) is sent flying by sudden braking as she prepares to descend from a bus, then mildly disturbed by the figure lurking in the hallway of her apartment block, terrified by the black youth playing sinister games with the lift doors, and in full hysterical flight by the time she bursts into her own home.

The ambience here is twofold, with the stunningly shot helicopter sequence suggesting either the placidly indifferent urban background against which a tale of domestic tribulations will unfold or the tortured setting for a gangster story of pain and sudden death. Where Cassavetes systematically demolished the conventions of the gangster genre in _The Killing of a Chinese Bookie_, in other words, here he keeps them going in tandem with more personal concerns.

So while the opening sequences of _Gloria_ are exemplary in genre terms (the frayed, nerve-end tensions which build the Puerto Rican girl’s nervous irritation into hysteria while the hoods coolly and systematically deploy their forces throughout the apartment block), they also incorporate thematic preoccupations which might seem more appropriate to films like _Faces_ or _Husbands_ (the astonishingly detailed history of family difficulties and differences glimpsed in the relationships between husband, wife, children and grandmother). Thereafter, Cassavetes replays genre scenes in his own terms: either paradoxically, as in the wonderfully funny scene in a sleazy hotel room where the six-year-old Phil, manfully playing up to the notion of himself as a guy faced with a doll, hopefully embarks on a seduction scene only to be kicked out of bed with the shaming recommendation to ‘Forget it; I outweigh you by sixty pounds!’; or critically, as in Gloria’s confrontation with Tony Tanzini, a classic genre climax where the traditional formalities are undermined since, instead of encountering opponents deployed as rigidly as pieces on a chessboard, she finds herself in a gangster headquarters manned by a puzzling array of people manifesting more interest in their own inexplicable concerns than in the business on hand.

While this reference to gangster conventions sometimes threatens to become repetitive (with Gloria winning the argument at gunpoint on four not-too-different occasions), any danger of stagnation is averted by the subtlety with which Cassavetes explores his central theme. The ‘song’ accompanying the credit titles, themselves superimposed over children’s paintings – a male voice cries the one word ‘Mama!’, wailingly echoed by a solo saxophone – suggests a concern for the motherless child expressed as simply and as sentimentally as in Cassavetes’ third film, _A Child Is Waiting_. _Gloria_, however, is neither simple nor, except in so far as it is a given of the plot that Gloria and Phil will develop a mother-son relationship, sentimental. Cassavetes cleverly negotiates this plot reef by demonstrating from the outset that under the tough images they like to project of themselves, his characters are unaware of their subconscious drives. ‘I am the man, not you!’, Phil yells angrily every time they come to a crossroads, but the end result is invariably Phil’s helpless ‘What do we do now?’; and Gloria, disgustedly declaring ‘I hate kids – especially yours!’ when asked to help, nevertheless instinctively discovers the right maternal ploy when, failing to arouse Phil from his lethargy with suggestions that they play ‘Twenty Questions’ or watch TV, she abruptly shoves her amiable cat into his arms.

A mother unconsciously in need of a son and vice versa, they must inevitably discover each other sooner or later; and the real motif of the film is the complex learning process whereby Gloria gradually moulds herself to the boy’s needs (her resentment, for instance, when he protests that she has killed the father of his ‘friend’, a boy he has only just casually met, gradually shading into her acceptance of the fact that she is indeed killing too much).

With superlative performances by Gena Rowlands and John Adames heading a fine cast, and equally superlative camerawork by Fred Schuler (a camera operator here making his debut as a director of photography), Gloria completes the movement begun by _Killing of a Chinese Bookie_ and _Opening Night_ towards a fascinating new stage in Cassavetes’ career, with the laxities of his earlier improvisational-locational-Method approach tightened up by the screws of Hollywood disciplines.
