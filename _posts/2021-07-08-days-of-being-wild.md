_+ pre-recorded intro by season programmer Ann Lee_

Leslie Cheung gives a magnificent performance as a rakish playboy in the 1960s searching for identity while callously breaking hearts. Wong hit his stride with his sophomore effort, tying together his favourite themes of time, memory and rejection in a hypnotic drama. Featuring a cast of Hong Kong’s  
biggest stars, it’s a poignant snapshot of youthful restlessness that’s an  artistic triumph.<br>

_Days_ _of_ _Being_ _Wild_ is already widely accepted as a modern classic, but it has had a worse than bumpy ride since an earlier version premiered in Hong Kong in December 1990. (The present version is Wong Kar Wai’s definitive cut, prepared for international release.) The first-release business in Pacific Asia was so poor that a planned Part Two – centred on Tony Leung’s gambler character, glimpsed here only in the closing scene, and set in 1966 – was never completed, although Wong Kar Wai’s recent _Ashes_ _of_ _Time_ seemingly does much of what he intended to do in that film. This film’s ‘mistake’, in the eyes of Asian audiences, was to defy all expectations aroused by the casting of six of the region’s top stars; it took two re-releases, a lot of critical support and a slew of Hong Kong Film Awards to rehabilitate the film and Wong’s career.

Wong himself was only two years old in his native Shanghai in 1960, and so _Days_ _of_ _Being_ _Wild_ represents a considerable feat of imaginative reconstruction. It’s also a tour de force of non-linear narrative, atmospherics, poetic rhythms and (thanks to sensational camerawork and design) visual writing – all of which sets it far apart from the slipshod norms of the Hong Kong film industry. The film is at once highly specific in its details and hallucinatory in its effect, a seeming contradiction that prevents it from lapsing into retro-chic for its own sake. Its essentially discrete scenes coalesce around elastic perceptions of time and space: clocks/watches and mirrors are key motifs, and Wong pays both formal and thematic attention to the ways his characters experience the passing of time. Fittingly, the intermittent source-music to which the minimal drama is choreographed oscillates between languorous Hawaiian steel guitars and bouncy Latino cha-cha arrangements.

As an existential account of solitary souls in random orbits, the film blows away the entire body of recent French ‘designer’ cinema. As a touchstone for Hong Kong’s specific identity and psyche, it’s close to sublime. Aside from the hapless, defeated Zeb, the characters are rootless and uncommitted to the territory: Rebecca is in extended transit between Shanghai/Manila and the USA, Su is constantly on the verge of returning home to Macau, Tide wants to drift, Yuddy wallows in inertia until he chooses to seek out his own death – an event the camera celebrates with a stunning Steadicam shot that is its only decisive movement in the whole film. Their relations with each other are consequently hesitant and unstable, quivering with a yearning for the warmth and commitment that might have been, balanced between dependency and hatred. Concomitant factors are the characters’ shaky sense of ambition and self-esteem, the endemic inability to value anything, and the moments of hysteria and anguish that bespeak unvoiced spiritual needs. This adds up to a view of Hong Kong and its people that looks forward to 1997 at least as much as it crystallises the city’s population-growth pangs of the 1960s. But the tone is tender and elegiac, never recriminatory or alarmist.

Nothing in Wong’s previous work as a screenwriter or director anticipated the structure or poetic density of _Days_ _of_ _Being_ _Wild_. If he had been able to realise the film as the intended diptych, the play with levels of time and memory would apparently have been even more sophisticated; he would also have been able to broaden his vision of the quintessential Hong Kong protagonist by matching Leslie Cheung’s playboy (the absurd name ‘Yuddy’ is an invention of the film’s original subtitler) with Tony Leung’s gambler. The enigmatic finale aside, though, the film feels complete enough as it stands: the poetic play with the established personae of its stars offers a level of satisfaction all its own, and the interwoven visual and aural motifs provide a credible level of consistency.

With hindsight, we know that Wong Kar Wai is capable of taking these formal ideas and themes in other directions: _Ashes_ _of_ _Time_ and _Chungking_ _Express_ use different forms and tonalities to get at similar places in the mind and heart from other angles of approach. They also confirm Wong as a key filmmaker for the 1990s. But _Days_ _of_ _Being_ _Wild_ will remain a peak in his filmography, and a landmark in Hong Kong cinema: the first film to rhyme nostalgia for a half-imaginary past with future shock.<br>
**Tony Rayns, _Sight and Sound_, December 1994**

The first part of an informal trilogy including _In the Mood for Love_ (2000) and _2046_ (2004), _Days of Being Wild_ saw Wong begin to incorporate a more international sound into his films. Opening with ‘Always in My Heart’ by the Brazilian guitar duo Los Indios Tabajaras, the film’s romantic songs create irony and a sense of distance, as main character Yuddy (Leslie Cheung) seeks refuge in casual relationships, only to soon abandon them and break hearts as a result.

‘Maria Elena’ is another cue – although Los Indios have an instrumental version themselves, this one is performed by Spanish bandleader Xavier Cugat, with multiple tracks played repeatedly throughout the film. Wong’s cues of other Cugat arrangements – ‘My Shawl’ and ‘Siboney’ – convey a longing that we can’t read on Leslie Cheung’s often impassive face, a longing that only becomes apparent towards the film’s closing.

_Days of Being Wild_ is a formative film for Wong both in visual and sonic terms. His attraction towards Latin music and his use of it to convey unspoken and unseen emotional angst is becoming ever more clear.<br>
