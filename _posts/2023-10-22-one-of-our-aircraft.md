Made quickly and relatively cheaply (for £700,000) at the height of the war, _One of Our Aircraft Is Missing_ was one of Powell and Pressburger’s early successes both critically and financially. Although the script is a little shapeless and the story tends to wander from one episode to another, the direction is taut and scenes are well handled by Powell. On the strength of its box-office, Powell and Pressburger were offered an unprecedented film-by-film deal with J. Arthur Rank, allowing them to choose their own projects.

_Aircraft_ was one of the first major film roles for Googie Withers – who had previously appeared in four Powell ‘quota quickies’ – as the Dutch resistance leader who comes to the airmen’s aid, and whose mixture of charm and determination baffles them. The character provides further evidence of the way the war was beginning to change society and the role of women, as does a similarly strong role for Pamela Brown. Both actresses attracted the attention of critic C.A. Lejeune in _The Observer_.

The gripping story of the airmen also impressed the _New Statesman_. Particularly striking is the opening sequence, in which Powell shoots each airman in close-up, creating intimacy and giving the audience a sense of the bomber’s cramped conditions and the dangers its crew face. The low position of the camera, looking admiringly up at the airmen, reinforces their heroism.

For the flying scenes, art director David Rawnsley covered the entire studio floor with a model of Stuttgart in miniature; cameraman Freddy Ford completed the aerial camera shots by lying flat on his stomach for ten hours a day high in the roof of the studio. The painstaking work paid off: the viewer feels the terrifying danger the airmen confront as they fly over enemy lines under fire from anti-aircraft guns.

The creation of such imaginary worlds was to become a hallmark of Powell and Pressburger’s films. _Aircraft_ signalled the end of the first phase of their partnership; with the freedom its success brought them, their work together now took an increasingly ambitious direction.

**Michael Powell on ‘One of Our Aircraft Is Missing’**  
_One of Our Aircraft Is Missing_ begins as a documentary, and gradually moves away from it. It was, after all, the first time the thing was done: the first time you dealt with a bombing raid. So a certain amount of authentic details was essential to build up the basic idea, which was to show what happens to a bomber crew in a neutral country occupied by the enemy. All our pictures arose from thinking along the lines of what was happening or what was going to happen. We hadn’t finished _49th Parallel_, when I said to Emeric ‘Does it interest you, the title _One of Our Aircraft Failed to Return_?’ – which was the current phrase on the radio at that time. He said ‘It’s an interesting idea,’ and then he thought up this story. By that time the phrase had changed. ‘Failed to return’ was obviously deemed officially too sad.

That marvellous plane crash at the beginning was typical Emeric: the empty plane flying back and crashing into a pylon. That is Emeric’s storytelling, though the way I shot it, of course, that’s up to me. It was all shot in a real bomber.

Another thing I said was, ‘As this is the first “real” war picture we’re doing, don’t let’s have any music: let’s have nothing but natural sound all the way through’ – which we did. The titles just had airplane noise, of course. The atmosphere carried itself, it didn’t need music.

In _One of Our Aircraft Is Missing_ there was a scene between the old rear-gunner, played by Godfrey Tearle, and the young pilot (Hugh Burden), which was cut out of the final picture. They’re leaning on a bridge after the episode in the church, and the old boy says to him ‘Nice girl, wasn’t she?’ and he says ‘Yes’. Tearle says ‘Do you think you’re coming back, after the war?’ and he says ‘I don’t know. I don’t know how I’ll get through the war.’ He laughs and they make some joke and he says ‘You know, you’ll think me mad, but you are like I was in the past, and you will become like I am now.’ And the young boy looked at him and said ‘You’re mad, George, what are you talking about?’ ‘You wouldn’t know anything about it, you young bastards, you’ve got exactly the same sort of general mentality and character that I had when I was young, and I tell you that in 40 years you’ll be just like me, a crusty old bugger.’ All this was cut out.

Emeric said, ‘I like that scene, let’s make a picture about it. I said it was a bloody good subject and then we got the idea of making it about Colonel Blimp.’

**A contemporary review**  
This is an exceedingly good flying-war film. Lovely photography, first-class direction, straightforward production and sincere acting from people who know their job put it at the top of its class so far. The story is based on fact, and full support has been given by the Services and the Royal Netherland Government. It is unique in that it does not include the ‘blonde bomb-shell’ interest. The acting is so good that it is invidious to make distinctions. It is, in short, a film worth seeing with excellent propaganda value, and is a credit to the British film industry.
