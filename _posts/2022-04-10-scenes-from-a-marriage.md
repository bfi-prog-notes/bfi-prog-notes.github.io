**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

Originally a six-part TV miniseries, _Scenes from a Marriage_ was subsequently edited into this feature-length cinema version. Created in the era of second-wave feminism, amidst rising divorce rates, this piercing portrait of a disintegrating marriage struck a chord with many audiences. As Marianne and Johan, Liv Ullmann and Erland Josephson have never been more tender, which makes the way they hurt one another all the more heart breaking.<br>

**A contemporary review**<br>
For six Wednesday evenings this spring [1973] Swedish television has been showing Ingmar Bergman’s _Scenes from a Marriage_, a series of 50-minute programmes made directly for TV. On these evenings, half of Sweden has taken the phone off the hook, and in thousands of homes people have used the Bergman series as a basis for discussion on the problems of living together. The destiny of the couple, Johan and Marianne, has been followed with the kind of interest that surrounded the richer and more gaudy gallery of characters in _The Forsyte Saga_.

In his first TV series (he previously made for television a documentary about his home island Fårö and the film _The Rite_), Bergman holds to his classical _kammerspiel_ tradition. Johan and Marianne (Erland Josephson and Liv Ullmann) completely dominate the drama. In two episodes they are the only characters; in others Bergman has introduced a couple of accessories to comment on or mirror their drama. Johan is a doctor, Marianne is a lawyer. They have been married some ten years, and have two daughters. They have what people would call ‘an ideal marriage’.

Bergman introduces us to this seeming idyll via an ironic stratagem. In the first scenes of the first episode Johan and Marianne are visited by a journalist from a woman’s weekly, who is inspecting the home and the relationship, asking treacherous questions and giving indiscreet sidelong looks. It is a malicious introduction, where nothing is allowed to break through the illusion. The journalist – and the audience – is presented with a solid facade: well-brushed children, a tidy home and a couple of well-expressed definitions on the notorious questions about love and happiness. But the cracks are there, and they widen as the series proceeds. Johan and Marianne’s existence is by no means free from problems. They talk with insight and awareness about their situation, but when a conversation risks becoming inflammable, they retreat via some suitable excuse. They try to come closer to each other, but they seem afraid of the touch, a touch which is real and serious and which might threaten their habits of life.

_Scenes from a Marriage_ is to a large extent a counterpoint to _The Touch_; and as in _The_ _Touch_, Bergman seems to mean that you have to go through a passion to be able to find your real self, your own face. You have to break loose from the comfortable prisons offered by the bourgeoisie and search for overwhelming experiences. Here, the husband one day, without warning, announces that he wants to leave his wife. For some time he has been seeing another woman, Paula. They are now planning to go to Paris for six months. Johan has got a scholarship and wants to leave immediately. The confession is brutal, and Marianne’s world falls apart. What will the children, their parents, their friends say? Her shock is no less when she discovers that their friends have long known about Johan’s affair.

This break-up takes place in the third episode, and the rest of the series shows how husband and wife, separately and together, arrive at a kind of private insight into themselves. In the fourth episode Johan looks Marianne up after his return from Paris. He regards the affair with Paula as important but a failure, and shows an unexpressed longing to come back to his wife. She confesses that she is still in love with Johan, but she doesn’t dare to get involved with him again.

In the fifth episode Marianne visits Johan at his office. She brings the forms for their divorce, but she also tries to seduce him. They quarrel and start to fight. In the final episode some ten years have passed. Both Johan and Marianne have remarried, and they have both reached a new kind of independence and understanding.

Bergman can be described as a conservative anarchist. He describes the moral life of his main characters exactly as they live themselves: quietly, without hurry, without stressing the development of their feelings, their thoughts or conversations. His language is listening, quiet, vigilant and understated. The style is even more close-up than in his recent films. The faces of the actors are Bergman’s dramatic landscape.

The world Bergman reveals is the protected rooms of the bourgeoisie; and this has been the main reason for some strong criticism of both his films and his TV series. Bergman does not make any kind of links with the society surrounding the figures in his films, and the problems he dwells on are therefore considered too private and exclusive. Only the bourgeoisie can afford time and money for these problems. This is true, but it doesn’t mean that the problems are irrelevant.

In one of his novels Dostoevsky lets one of his characters say (thus portraying Tolstoy): ‘If I were a Russian novelist and if I had talent, I would always choose my characters from the Russian nobility, because only in this background do you find the outer appearance of fine discipline and noble motives…’ Bergman locks his problems up in the same kind of ‘noble milieu’ where pure and clear truths can be formed. But if _The_ _Touch_ or _Scenes from a Marriage_ is Bergman’s _Anna Karenina_, one misses here the network of contacts to a world outside which was always held open in Tolstoy’s novel. In _Scenes from a Marriage_, for instance, Johan and Marianne’s children are practically forgotten after the first episode. And when Bergman introduces other people around Johan and Marianne (the series is spiced with excellent bit performances from players like Bibi Andersson and Gunnel Lindblom), one would want to see either more of them or less because they demand a place in the lives of the husband and wife.

Paradoxically enough, the episodes where Johan and Marianne are completely alone emerge as the most engaging and emotionally true. Here the issues are clean and clear. Johan and Marianne are no ideal characters. They talk to us, shamelessly direct, vulnerable and unprotected. And we are allowed to share an experience.<br>
