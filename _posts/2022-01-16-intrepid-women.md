Six foot in her socks, the glamorous Aloha Wanderwell bestrides the world in jodhpurs: one of the highly visible female adventurers of the early 20th century and the inspiration for later generations of women through film. Join BFI National Archive curator Bryony Dixon and Dr Sarah Evans (Royal Geographical Society) for this illustrated talk introducing some of the early women explorers and their films, including Rosita Forbes, Hettie Dyhrenfurth, Osa Johnson and aviation legend Amy Johnson.

**Excelsior**  (1931)

Hettie Dyhrenfurth was the  German-Swiss mountaineer wife of famous mountaineer G.O. Dyhrenfurth. A record of the international attempt to climb the mountain Kangchenjunga in the Himalayas in 1930.

**Java**  (1931)  
Amateur colour film by Mrs Patrick Ness from the collection of the Royal Geographical Society, taken in Java during her travels and showing Batavia (now Jakarta), Mount Papandayan, Kawah Kamojang and Borobodur temple. Scenes include women washing clothes, Batavia market and canal, market porters, terraced rice fields, rice drying, hot springs and geysers, flower market and a procession, oxen and market porters, harvesting cereal crops, temple architecture, women planting rice, ploughing rice paddy, a waterfall and  
jungle goats.

Elizabeth Ness (also known as Mrs Patrick Ness) died in 1962. She was elected a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in 1918 and was the first woman to become a Member of Council. In 1953 she endowed the Mrs Patrick Ness Award, to be presented by the RGS ‘either to travellers who have successfully carried out their plans, or to encourage travellers who wish to pursue or follow up investigations which have been partially completed.’  A competent photographer, she was one of the first travellers to use 16mm cinematographic film in colour.

**Baboona: An Aerial Epic of Africa**  (1933)  
The Johnsons, Osa and Martin, flew over 60,000 miles in two amphibious planes, taking aerial images of the landscapes, mountains jungles of Africa, gaining access to locations previously unavailable to white explorers.

**River of Death**  (1934)  
The explorer and aviatrix Aloha Wanderwell’s only sound film, covering the trip she and her husband Captain Wanderwell made to the Mato Grosso region of Brazil in the Amazon jungle to try to find traces of British explorer Col. Percival Fawcett. She learned to fly a seaplane and almost lost her life in an emergency landing in the jungle. Walter had to hike out, leaving Aloha and the cameraman behind to stay with an Amazonian tribe.

**Dual Control** (1932)  
Charming short film with the famous flier Amy Johnson in which her fiancé aviator Jim Mollison lands in a field in rural England, having run out of petrol.  
He has already attracted a crowd by the time Amy flies in to meet him.  She takes a schoolboy up in the plane, while they wait for fuel. He is impressed enough to admit to having been piloted by a woman.

Johnson and Mollison, never quite at ease with such scripted fare, had announced their engagement in May 1932. They first met during Amy’s victory tour of Australia in 1930, when she achieved international fame by becoming the first woman to fly solo from England. In 1933 the couple completed a transatlantic crossing in their plane Seafarer, surviving a serious crash-landing, but eventually separated in 1936.
