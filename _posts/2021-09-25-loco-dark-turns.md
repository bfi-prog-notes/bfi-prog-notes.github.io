BAFTA-recognised festival LOCO aka The London Comedy Film Festival is back to share the best comedy short films rescued from the madness of 2020 in this Comedy Shorts Weekender, in partnership with MindsEye.

Sometimes a film leaves you unsure whether to laugh or scream, to feel amused or disturbed. These short comedy films revel in the funny dimensions of the dark, the daunting, and the downright disgusting. Their stories of ghoulish games, dodgy government policy, regrettable trips and the sinister side of acapella prove that no area is out of bounds for comedy.
