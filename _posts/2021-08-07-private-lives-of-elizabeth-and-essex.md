This fictional take on the tempestuous and troubled relationship between Queen Elizabeth I and the Duke of Essex chronicles the rise and fall of a privileged and popular member of the royal court. Davis lobbied for Laurence Olivier to play Essex but the role went to Flynn. For her own role as the Queen she researched the Elizabethan period to ensure that her look and accent were as authentic as she could make them in this, her first colour film.

Maxwell Anderson’s play _Elizabeth the Queen_ was a highly successful vehicle for Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne: their only film together _The Guardsman_, opens with an extended extract from it, showing how effective it could be for an actor and actress able to make believable its many elaborate dialogue sequences where innocuous and courtly conversation must be felt to make a sexual attraction. Laurence Olivier was originally cast to play Essex in this film version, but when he became unavailable, the part was given to the inappropriate Flynn who, though physically wrong for the part, was sufficiently certain of success as to demand a title change in order to accentuate what he felt to be a central role. Curtiz, despairing, gave all his attention to Bette Davis as Elizabeth, and she turned in one of her most memorable performances.

Few of Curtiz’s films are as meticulously elaborate as this, which sacrifices physical action for a flawless technical exercise in historical recreation. Its sets, music score, colour photography, special effects and sound recording were all nominated for Oscars, though the board that year was swept by _Gone with  
the Wind_.

The film remains one of the lushest of the time, an interesting contrast to current TV versions of Elizabeth’s court which, while they exceed the film in dramatic quality, seem sadly disadvantaged by a lack of the physical resources on which Hollywood could call.

The acting, however, remains the most satisfying aspect of the film, with Davis capturing superbly the mercurial nature of the queen as well as her femininity, while veteran character actors like Henry Daniell and Vincent Price intrigue darkly on the sidelines. It may be, as many have charged, a simplistic view of a complex incident, but as filmmaking it is above criticism.

**A contemporary review**  
As a spectacle this film has seldom been matched. The Technicolor is admirable, and court scenes in Elizabethan dress lend themselves to representation in this medium. There is also some magnificent pageantry – e.g. the return of Essex from Cadiz, some eerie sequences in Ireland; and some beautiful backgrounds, e.g. the closing scene at the Tower and a lovely picture of hawk-flying. Dramatically, the story fails. It is not quite big enough to be really tragic. This is partly due to casting. Errol Flynn is a fine figure of a man, with a Robin Hood-like charm but – compared with Bette Davis – he is no actor. She is in her element. No other star can so effectively portray neurotic and fierce hatred and passionate love. She storms, rages, is icily bitter, and yet pathetic in her longing for affection. She is not only a lonely woman, but a queen with the brain of a statesman, and a shrewd and wide knowledge of men and affairs. Among a practically all-star supporting cast, Donald Crisp’s portrait of Francis Bacon stands out as an admirable little cameo.
