_Bread & Roses_ offers an unflinching look at the lives of Afghan women following the Taliban’s return to power in Kabul in 2021. Co-produced by Jennifer Lawrence and Malala Yousafzai and directed by Sahra Mani, the film draws on footage captured by the women themselves, documenting their daily resistance and collective struggle for dignity, education, and freedom.

Through the eyes of three protagonists – Zahra, Taranom and Sharifa – the film provides a rare perspective from inside a regime that has systematically erased women from public life. _Bread & Roses_ is both a cry for justice and a testimony to courage.

The screening will be followed by a Q&A exploring the film’s context and the wider importance of creative expression in the face of injustice.

Premiered at the 2023 Cannes Film Festival in a special screening, _Bread & Roses_ received wide international recognition. The film was awarded the 2025 Peabody Award for Documentary, nominated for the Cinema Eye Honors Award for Outstanding Achievement in Broadcast Film, and shortlisted for the Golden Eye Award at Cannes, affirming its place as a landmark work in contemporary human rights cinema.

This exclusive event is presented in partnership with the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and Counterpoints Arts as part of this year’s Refugee Week festival.
