On a busy, noisy high-traffic street corner in Alexandria, Egypt, a seemingly vacant corner lot surrounded by chain link fencing is the training site of Egypt’s most elite champions – female weightlifters.

Zebiba (Arabic for ‘raisin’) has been training at the site for five years, since she was 9, following in the footsteps of Egypt’s most famous athletes of all time – including the first Arab, female, two-time Olympic medallist, Abeer Abdel Rahman, and world champion and Olympic athlete, Nahla Ramadan. Nahla’s father, the visionary Captain Ramadan, has bred champions, female champions, from his makeshift corner-lot training site for over two decades – 4 Olympic, 9 World and 17 Pan African champions.

Now it is Zebiba’s turn. But can Zebiba put aside her youthful instincts, and direct her focus to be the weightlifting champion the Captain is sure she is?<br>

**Zebiba**<br>
Zebiba’s real name is Asmaa Ramadan. Although her last name is Ramadan as the Captain’s, she is not his daughter. It is just a coincidence or maybe not that they share the same last name, since the two share a very special relationship. It was Captain Ramadan who nicknamed her Zebiba (meaning Raisin in Arabic), because when she first started training, she was so little and as tiny as a raisin.<br>

**Captain Ramadan**<br>
A former weightlifter and an Olympic athlete who has been coaching women weightlifters for more than 20 years. He has a proven track record of success and more than 400 medals. He is the coach/father of Nahla Ramadan and Nagham Ramadan; the first Egyptian/Arab women to play weightlifting. Yet, Nagham the eldest is a junior world champion bronze medallist while Nahla is a world champion gold medallist, a former world record holder and an Olympic athlete. Captain Ramadan is also the coach of Abeer Abdel Rahman, who is the first Arab female two-time Olympic medallist weightlifter.<br>
