Bette Davis shows her considerable range and ambition with the role of Mildred Rogers, who torments a would-be doctor (Howard) who’s obsessed with her. With several pictures under her belt and under contract to Warners, Davis begged to be allowed to work for RKO in a role turned down by other leading actresses afraid that the unglamorous role of Mildred would harm their careers. Considered a shoe-in for an Oscar® nomination, the omission was big news at the time and it marked Davis as a star in the making.

Of the great stars, Bette Davis is a rare example, not only through her gifts, but because she has asserted the value of imagination and technical ability in a profession that can be followed without much of either. Her present supremacy was, perhaps, inevitable if she were to succeed at all. When she first arrived in Hollywood in 1930, after a few years in stock companies and success in a Broadway play, she was not a type to be prefabricated into any existing mould. She demanded, in fact, the creation of a new approach, which the unfortunate results of her first screen test emphasised. (‘I was badly dressed for the camera, the lighting was awful ...’) Her first few films were failures; in 1932 she was given a contract by Warner Brothers, then a pioneering company, but of her parts in the first 15 or so films she made there – _So Big_, an early Wellman film, Curtiz’s _Cabin in the Cotton_, and _Ex-Lady_, in which she became officially a ‘star’ – only one, relatively small (_Cabin in the Cotton_) was really rewarding.  In most of the others she was cast as a kind of mild sex-menace (fashion artist, career girl, gangster’s moll), and she usually presented the spectacle of character struggling against type, and working too hard to establish the fact.

She was to remain under contract to Warners for more than 16 years, but her career as an actress was effectively started by David Selznick, then a producer at R.K.O. He had already launched Hepburn in _Bill of Divorcement_, and decided in 1934 to cast Bette Davis as Mildred in the film of Maugham’s  
_Of Human Bondage_. This was to be the first proper revelation of her talents. For the first time a film needed her, and she didn’t need a film. The director, John Cromwell, had come to Hollywood from the theatre, and was skilled with actors. _Of Human Bondage_, a conscientious though not inspired adaptation, was angled to give both Bette Davis and Leslie Howard the strongest possible prominence, and indeed allowed them to present the kind of character at which they were later to excel again – for him the nervous, vacillating intellectual, for her the unscrupulous, ambitious, coldly passionate little waitress, developed as a saloon-keeper’s wife in _Bordertown_, the alcoholic actress in _Dangerous_, finally reformed in _Jezebel_.

For her siren roles and publicity build-up, her hair had been dyed blonde: before, this had been irrelevant, but as Mildred she used it as she has since used a variety of make-up, with enormous skill and as an imaginative adjunct to the presentation of character. One thing that _Of Human Bondage_ made clear was the degree of artifice that, as an actress, she could assimilate.  
Here she used cheap clothes, dyed hair, a pale make-up that fringed her eyes with black and voluptuously filled out her mouth, as positive appurtenances. Few actresses, especially on the screen, have succeeded in doing this, and none has done it more effectively.

For, miraculously, the face had ‘taken’, the full range of mobility, expression, temperament, had broken through the earlier image. She was only 26 when she played Mildred, but her face disclosed the sort of potentialities that actresses usually attain only when they are ten years older. It was youthful, but it had a past; it had an ageless quality that could be stressed in either direction. Seven years later she was to play Regina in _The Little Foxes_ – a woman in her early forties – and the year after that the spoilt, nymphomaniac Stanley of  
_In This Our Life_, looking more than ten years younger. The face is not beautiful, but it is mysterious, fascinating, with an extraordinary faculty for being itself and somebody else at the same time – the sort of face Norma Desmond in _Sunset Boulevard_ brooded over.  
**Gavin Lambert, _Sight and Sound_, August-September 1951**

In her frst scene in _Hell’s House_ (1932), an independently produced quickie shot in two weeks, Bette Davis is standing on a street corner and looking mightily irritated because her boyfriend (Pat O’Brien) is late. Her face looks truly disgusted, and this image of frank female loathing still seems unusual. She is very green and tentative in _Hell’s House_, but every so often the camera will catch her eyes lighting up and something seems about to happen, something bad, most likely, though it never does.

Davis is just ‘the girlfriend’ in _Hell’s House_, and she played lots of parts like that while at Warner Bros – so many that her restlessness and fury were all  
pent up when Warner loaned her to RKO to be Mildred in an adaptation of  
W. Somerset Maugham’s _Of Human Bondage_ (1934). A sadistic waitress obsessed over by the masochistic Philip (Leslie Howard), Mildred is a girl with no redeeming features, a manipulator on a pitifully obvious scale, always looking sideways whenever she wants to judge how badly she can treat this weak man who is enslaved to her, and Davis refuses to ask for any sympathy and she refuses to psychologise.

_Of Human Bondage_ is slow and strangely edited, and it seems as if no one involved has given much thought to what it might be about. Howard is inadequate, and sometimes comically so. But Davis’s nihilistic performance as Mildred is still like a thunderstorm, full of flashes of lightning, low rumbling and one unforgettably massive outburst when Mildred explodes with all the hate in the world at the camera and at us, so that the repeated cutaways to Howard’s Philip don’t seem to be shot in the same room or on the same planet. Watching Davis tell off this man is like watching any great and fearful natural phenomenon. It’s not acting, finally. It’s something else, something closer to electrical power or some awesome disaster excitingly destroying everything in its wake.
