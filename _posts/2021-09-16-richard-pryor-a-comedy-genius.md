_We are delighted to welcome comedian, writer and presenter Angie Le Mar and comedian, writer and actor Kojo Anim for this discussion hosted by Anthony Andrews (We are Parable)._

Join us for a richly illustrated panel discussion, presented in partnership with We Are Parable, that will explore Pryor’s memorable stand-up moments and film roles. We’ll reflect on how he used his personal experiences as inspiration for his comedic work and how he revolutionised the comedy genre. Our special guests will also discuss his legacy, and his influence on a huge number of comedians that followed.

**Angie Le Mar** was the first Black female stand-up on the British comedy circuit. Thirty years later, she is recognised as a multi-award winning comedienne, TV and radio presenter/star, business woman, entrepreneur, speaker, director, producer and writer. Angie recently appeared on ITV’s _Craig & Danny: Funny, Black & On TV_ and _Black, British & Funny_, a new Channel 4 documentary by Mo Gilligan.

**Kojo Anim** has fast become one of the funniest talents to come out of the UK comedy circuit in the last 10 years. While his first love was always football, he started using his humour to make people laugh in his local team. Kojo has since opened up for Chris Rock, Kevin Hart at Wembley Arena and Dave Chappelle at the Royal Albert Hall. In 2018 Kojo became a father for the first time to his son Roman-Kingsley and is now penning a new 1 hour show all about fatherhood. Kojo was the finalist on the series 13 of TV talent show _Britain’s Got Talent_ and received Simon Cowell’s prestigious Golden Buzzer.

**Host: Anthony Andrews** is a multi-award winning co-founder and creative director of We Are Parable, a film exhibition company which provides audiences across the UK opportunities to experience Black Cinema in culturally relevant and memorable ways. With a decade’s experience in the film industry, Anthony has collaborated with some of the biggest studios in the world, including Netflix, Warner Brothers, Prime Video, Marvel and Disney.  
Since forming the business, Anthony has worked with Idris Elba, Justin Simien, Amma Asante and Spike Lee and has interviewed Academy Award winners Steve McQueen and Jennifer Hudson. In 2020, Anthony co-curated Who We Are, an unprecedented digital takeover of the BFI, which celebrated the canon of Black British Cinema. Earlier this year, a new iteration of Who We Are was launched, with We Are Parable creating experiences for Black Cinema across the UK, whilst collaborating with some of the UK’s most well-known independent cinemas.<br>
