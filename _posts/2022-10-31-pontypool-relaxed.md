_+ intro and discussion._

Terror strikes an Ontario town after an aural virus infects its inhabitants, with radio announcer  
Grant Mazzy (Stephen McHattie) the last line of defence against the zombie hordes.  
Bruce McDonaldâ€™s terrifying horror offers a new twist on the zombie formula by exploring the nightmarish qualities of language and the dangers of uncontrolled repetition.

Selected and hosted by Ethan Lyon, co-host of the Autism Through Cinema podcast.
