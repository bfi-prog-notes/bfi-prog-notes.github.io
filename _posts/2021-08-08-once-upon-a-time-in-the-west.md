Reflecting Morricone’s admiration for the Second Viennese School, this remains among his peak achievements. His score is tightly bound into the pitiless study of frontier greed and depravity concocted by Leone in conjunction with Bernardo Bertolucci and Dario Argento.

Once again, it was written in advance and each of the principals has a theme that becomes interwoven into the mood music. The widowed Jill (Claudia Cardinale) is represented by a dulcimer, flute and the angelic voice of Edda Dell’Orso, while the debased soul of Frank the gunslinger (Henry Fonda) is suggested by Bruno Battisti D’Amario’s razzing guitar. The guitar part no longer has the Hank Marvin twang of the Dollars triptych, as it duels chillingly during the McBain massacre with a wailing harmonica, which in turn denotes the hired gun (Charles Bronson) on Frank’s tail. Morricone set out to ‘wound the audience’s ears like a blade’ and he audaciously succeeds.

**The Sound of Music  
Morricone, John Cage and ‘Once upon a Time in the West’**

**Christopher Frayling:** _You were part of a seminar with John Cage, at Darmstadt in Germany in 1958, and subsequently in the 1960s you joined an improvisation group called Nuova Consonanza…_

**Ennio Morricone:** John Cage was a massive influence on many composers at that time – and I’m talking not just about avant-garde music but also music in general. For example, he gave importance to the _pauses_ in music – the absence of sound – that’s something that came from Cage. He also made the _isolated_ sound very important… all this led to a correction and therefore Cage influenced all composers, traditional and avant garde.

_Did these ideas have any influence on your western scores?_

The music I composed for film, TV, radio and music hall is one story, and the music I composed as a composer is what I call ‘absolute music’, which is a different thing. That’s what I studied for.

_So you tend to associate your film work with ‘applied music’ – like the distinction between an art and a craft…_

Yes, it’s a different process. For instance, when I was writing symphonic music or chamber music, what I had to do was to wait for a few days after having composed film music because I had somehow to get rid of being conditioned to write film music in order to write absolute music.

_I still think there’s a connection between your avant-garde experiments and your film music. For example, some of the ‘instruments’ you use in your film music include sounds that are not normally associated with music._

There is some history to this. There was at that time a French school of musicians who used sounds from reality, like traffic sounds. What we did in the group Nuova Consonanza was to make that kind of music into a different kind of music that was not reality any more. We understood that all kinds of sounds – the sounds of reality that we all know – if you take them out of the context in which they’re originally created, they become something different. For example, the sound of a fly that flies close to a microphone surrounded by silence is not, when you think about it, actually a real sound. This use of sound actually enabled me to create the music I have created.

An extreme example of this happened during a concert in Florence at the Conservatory. Our group was due to play in the second half. In the first half, the concert was supposed to begin but didn’t. People waited and there was no music.

There was a man who went on a ladder up to the balcony that surrounded the stage, high up. People hadn’t even noticed him because they thought he worked there. It was 10.15pm and the concert still hadn’t begun. He was trying to creak the ladder by moving it! People kept thinking: ‘Well, the concert must be about to begin’ – when all of a sudden the audience realised that the concert _had_ in fact begun. They kept quiet and he kept creaking this ladder. Everyone was very upset, as you can imagine. It was a huge scandal! Even for me. But, on second thoughts, I realised that – as I was saying – any sound that is taken out of its real context actually acquires a totally different meaning.

I said this to Sergio Leone, and for [the opening of] _Once upon a Time in the West_ there was that deep silence, then the creaking windmill, the telegraph, the water dropping on the hat and so on. He applied this principle. I had talked to Leone about this, and from that, it all started. It was true that in that case it _was_ aided by the images!  
**Extract from an interview with Morricone by Christopher Frayling, reprinted in _Sight & Sound_, December 2020**

It is tempting to see _Once upon a Time in the West_ as the outcome of the meeting of Leone’s cynicism and Bertolucci’s Marxism. In its style and its ambitions it pushed the Italian Western as far as it could go. The full version is certainly one of the most remarkable films of its time – a materialist fairy tale which, where given the chance, struck a chord at the box-office. Leone’s style, evolved in the earlier films, expanded its spare outlines to grandiose but appropriate proportions. The film becomes an epic without pretensions to historical precision (hence the title) but to being an emblematic tale, comparable with Italian political movies like _Quemada_, and also in a sense the ultimate Western.

Most major Western themes are there, but, through Leone’s artificial, operatic style, the film becomes a view from Europe, based on American historical mythology but presenting it precisely as an alien mythology. The traditional function of the Western is undercut and its iconography used to say, in effect, that it does not wash any more: that life in the West, past and present, is nasty, brutish and short; ‘heroes’ and villains pursue money; and nobility comes only through preserving personal dignity, avenging evil, and turning one’s back on the world created by corrupt and crazy moneymakers.
