In her semi-autobiographical film, Ann Hui casts Cheung as Hueyin, an aspiring journalist living in London who is called back to Hong Kong to attend her sister’s wedding. Reunited with her family, Hueyin struggles to connect with her mother, who has her own painful experiences of immigration. Cheung’s subtle but heartrending performance perfectly expresses her character’s complex inner journey as she attempts to understand and forgive her parents.

The standout feature of the 14th Hong Kong Festival was the quality of the movies from Hong Kong itself. The massacre in Tiananmen Square has concentrated the minds of the colony’s leading filmmakers, forcing them to confront the implications of 1997, and to question their own future place in the Chinese scheme of things. A new sense of purpose is imparting a backbone to the local cinema that it has too often lacked.

After a shaky start, set in London in 1973, Ann Hui’s _Song of the Exile_ rapidly finds a proper tone as the story shifts to Asia. Semi-autobiographical, it is a poetic exploration of the emotional and cultural gap between an English-educated Hong Kong girl and her Japanese mother, both deplacees and in search of their roots. The action ranges widely in place and time from the 1940s to the 70s, with scenes set in Manchuria, Macao, Canton and Japan, and the director employs a brilliantly modulated colour palette to provide a tonal code for the film’s swiftly changing moods.

The mother finally makes the trip back to her birthplace but finds that she no longer relates to Japanese values. The lifeline has been too long severed and those with whom she ought to be as one have become strangers. In this beautiful and moving film, it is not hard to see a metaphor for another kind of homecoming seven years down the road.

Maggie Cheung was born in Hong Kong, but when she was six her family emigrated to Kent in England, where she was the only Chinese kid on the block and in school: ‘I was teased a lot.’ Working briefly in a bookstore, she realised that as a woman of colour she would always be ‘second choice’ for better things, even in the modelling industry. At 17 she went back to Hong Kong, where she became a successful cover girl, but quickly suffered from ‘overexposure’ (‘I did McDonald’s, I did hair, I did clothes’). She entered one of the beauty pageants that constitute the main recruiting ground for starlets in Hong Kong and as first runner-up was offered a part in a light comedy only two weeks after the competition. ‘At that time directors thought that Maggie Cheung was very beautiful, but couldn’t be a good actress,’ remembers Stanley Kwan. ‘I was mostly asked to do reaction shots,’ Cheung comments, ‘like opening my eyes and my mouth wide when frightened.’ Then in 1988, Wong Kar-Wai, who was preparing his first film, _As Tears Go By_, a gangster movie with unusual twists, offered her the part of the protagonist’s love interest. ‘At that time, she didn’t have much ambition for her acting career, because of the kind of roles she was offered,’ reminisces Wong. ‘I noticed that, if given a lot of dialogue, she would become very nervous; then I cut most of her lines, so she could concentrate on her body language, which is something she was very good at.’

‘Wong Kar-Wai opened that door for me,’ says Cheung. ‘He made me understand that acting is not just about expressions, but comes from inside. The whole body should follow, not just the face or eyes.’ Stanley Kwan, known as a sensitive director of actresses, was completely taken by Cheung’s performance in _As Tears Go By_. He cast her in _Full Moon in New York_ (1989) as a tough-as-nails yet vulnerable Hong Kong woman living in New York who meets two other immigrants, Sylvia Chang from Taiwan and Siqin Gaowa from mainland China. The film won Cheung her first Golden Horse Award (Taiwan’s government-sponsored film awards), and 1990 was a glorious year. Ann Hui cast her as her stand-in in _Song of the Exile_, a delicately crafted autobiographical recounting of Hui’s uneasy relationship with her Japanese-born mother. Then Cheung gathered a lot of praise in a supporting role as Lin Ching-hsia’s best friend in Yim Ho’s romantic/historical epic _Red Dust_, before exploring a more expressionist mode of acting as an immigrant turned murderous schizophrenic in Clara Law’s _Farewell China_. Yet none of these achievements had prepared viewers for the emotional depth reached by Cheung in _Days of Being Wild_.

_Why did you decide to make an autobiographical film after_ Starry Is the Night _?_

I wanted to shoot this film back in 1983. There were many production problems and I also worried whether l should make it and how it would be interpreted. Then I found Wu Nien-jen to write the script. We worked together well. He thought the film could be made. We agreed on the format and the treatment and so went ahead.

_Is the Taiwan producer a result of his involvement?_

The Taiwan producer asked me to make a film; I suggested the story I had earlier shown it to Hong Kong producers but they weren’t too sure of the big budget and the location shooting. They worried about not being able to recoup the investment as the story is not commercial enough. I had doubts myself.  Wu Nien-jen tried to sell the story to a producer with whom he had had a long association. The producer wanted to make a quality film at the risk of losing money.

_Was your collaboration with Wu any different from working with Hong Kong scriptwriters?_

No, it was just like working with the best Hong Kong scriptwriters. Wu’s scripts are very sophisticated in their structure, in cutting back and forth. Nothing pretentious or overdone. He’s not theoretical about it, he just writes it all out.

_In shooting this film, did you experience more constraints than when shooting epics, such as_ Romance of Book and Sword _?_

Each kind of film has its own constraints and difficulties. With epics, you’ve constraints such as props, etc. but many problems can be solved if you’ve money. A film like _Song of the Exile_ is more difficult because of your demand on the actors/actresses. They don’t think of the film as a whole, just scene by scene. This habit is the major constraint. My limitation is how to instruct the cast to deliver the finer details required in their interpretation. You feel the problem but you can’t solve it. As a director, l like to make this kind of film because the different constraints raise your expectations.
