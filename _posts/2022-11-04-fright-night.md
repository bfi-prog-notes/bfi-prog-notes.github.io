When certified horror buff Charlie Brewster becomes convinced the two guys next door are vampires, everyone thinks he’s just watched too many spooky movies. But as the signs add up, Charlie turns to veteran horror host Peter Vincent for help. A pitch-perfect blend of horror, humour and homoeroticism, this much-loved cult classic is a fascinating study of nonconformity and otherness, offering a bounty of queer subtext to sink your teeth into.

**A contemporary review**  
Although, thanks to John Landis and Rick Baker, the werewolf seems to be having little difficulty in keeping up with the 1980s (actually achieving teenage idol status as the break-dancing basketball champion in _Teen Wolf_), the vampire is finding it less easy to shake off the Carpathian image. Tom Holland (whose script for _Psycho II_ similarly sought to update Gothic nightmares) has now applied the sophistication of the _Ghostbusters_ era to the familiar iconography of the undead, complete with coffins, stakes, and lethal giant bats. It’s an enterprising hybridisation, for which Dracula fans may be expected to raise at least an anaemic smile of approval.

From his careers as actor (prolific) and screenplay writer (modest), Holland has evidently learned enough to put together an efficient first film as director. Elegantly photographed by Vilmos Zsigmond’s former assistant Jan Kiesser, _Fright Night_ is unarguably a smoother ride, and with more comfortable performances than, for instance, Wes Craven’s horrendously ugly and edgy _Nightmare on Elm Street_. There are plenty of pleasing details, like the curl of a wood shaving over an impermeable fingernail as it slides grimly along a bannister, the mother placidly offering her son a Valium when he has just avoided being flung out of a window, or the vampire listening with modest pride to his rival’s distant scream at the discovery that Amy has been fanged. Owing nothing to special effects but everything to script and timing, two particularly happy encounters are the scene in which Charley’s accusations are outfaced by the vampire’s politely incredulous assistant (an appealing acting debut by Jonathan Stark), and the sequence when Dandridge mesmerises Amy on the dance floor and calmly tosses aside the heavies who come to her defence. If the old legend is to offer any kind of chill in a modern context, these are surprisingly convincing illustrations.

Chris Sarandon plays the monster as the established smoothie, a plausible neighbourhood psychopath right up to the disappointing moment of dissolution when the eyes go weird, the teeth grow, and the single objective is a box in the cellar. Holland rounds it all off with a battle royal amidst the antique furniture, bolts of sunlight knocking the antagonists across the room and crushing the darkness in a whirlwind of flames. The snarling enemy deserves a better opponent, however, than the miscast Roddy McDowall, whose chalk-dust hair and beakily aggrieved expression are, of all the film’s challenges, by far the least persuasive. William Ragsdale, another newcomer, captures more accurately the script’s tone of part-fearful, part-hopeful bemusement, a horror-film fan by no means averse to finding the Universal classics coming to life next door. A pity, though, that after his first mauling by his supernatural adversary he shows not a single bruise.
