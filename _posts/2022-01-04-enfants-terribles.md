Melville was something of a hero to the Nouvelle vague – Godard cast him in _Breathless_ – and Truffaut, like many, admired this adaptation of Cocteau’s novel for its fidelity, the serenity and strength of the direction, and the excellence of the performances. It concerns the fraught relationship between a young woman and her sickly brother who retreat into a private realm where jealousy and insecurity are rife.<br>

Even before it came out _Les Enfants terribles_ commanded much critical attention. On-set conflicts between Melville and Cocteau were the talk of the town and, in order to scotch the (partly self-fuelled) rumours that it was his film, Cocteau told _France-Soir_, ‘Although I worked with Melville hand in hand, the film is his, not mine.’ Melville for his part stated on numerous occasions that Cocteau left him alone after he asserted himself on day one of shooting, ejecting Cocteau who had ‘inadvertently’ said ‘cut’ from the set. Cocteau reportedly directed one day of shooting, of scenes at the ‘seaside’ (in fact shot in a small town north of Paris, as is plainly evident). Still, this did not stop reviewers trying to apportion the relative inputs of the two men and, inevitably, in this game Melville was overshadowed by Cocteau.

On its release the film violently divided critical opinion, while box-office sales were average (its total of 719,844 tickets was significantly fewer than for  
_Le Silence de la mer_). Jacques Siclier noted that ‘its career was mostly in film clubs’. From the left-wing _Combat_ to the Catholic _La Croix_, Melville was deemed to have made an excellent adaptation of a canonical book, retaining its ‘spirit’ and ‘making a very good job of a difficult task.’ On the other hand his camera movements were felt by some to be excessive and Cocteau’s voice-over overbearing. In several cases _Les Enfants terribles_ was compared unfavourably to _Le Silence de la mer_. Actors’ performances however united all critics, then and later: Nicole Stéphane’s Elisabeth was universally lauded while Dermithe’s Paul was comprehensively condemned.

The fiercest attacks, though, were directed at the film’s contents, and therefore at Cocteau. _L’Écran français_, the leading specialist film journal of the Liberation, which had championed _Le Silence de la mer_, trashed the film, calling it a ‘grotesque story’ with a ‘pseudo-poetic commentary crammed with wilfully obscure terms.’ _L’Aube_ condemned it for wallowing in the ‘moral indigence of bourgeois bohemian youth’ while _Franc-Tireur_ described the bedroom as ‘a dustbin in which lie, pell-mell, human detritus.’ Homosexual and incestuous undertones were not picked up as such. This could be because they were toned down from the novel. Reportedly, a shot showing Elisabeth and Paul in a passionate embrace was cut, although there is no trace of this in the Censorship Commission files, a fact which suggests self-censorship in anticipation of what would be acceptable to the audience.’ Instead, surrealism was the overt focus of attack. Whether favourable or unfavourable to the film, reviewers in such publications as _Le Monde_ hated ‘the hideous apparatus of Surrealism, the moustachioed statues, the artificial flowers and the convoluted objects dear to the creator of _Le Sang d’un poète_.’ It is conceivable that these attacks may have been disguised homophobia since there were also veiled references to Dermithe’s ‘effeminate’ looks.

Two years after the film’s release, Noël Burch wrote a detailed textual analysis of it that can hardly be bettered. Burch exhaustively examines the complex camerawork, the role of music, the substitution of visual for verbal poetry and the use of objects. Burch’s originality was to claim full authorship of the film for Melville: ‘_Les Enfants terribles_ may be a great film because of Cocteau’s novel, but it is that, especially in spite of, and beyond, the novel.’ For Burch, Melville was, ‘with Bresson, Franju and Tati, the only French filmmaker who was capable of making a film which is art, like a string quartet, a poem or a painting, independently of any intellectual or literary content.’ Burch thus perceived at the time the shift historians such as Kristin Thompson and David Bordwell later would chart: ‘_Les Enfants terribles_ exemplifies the rethinking of the relation between film and other arts that was taking place in post-war modernism.’

It is worth noting that the re-release of _Les Enfants terribles_ in the mid-1970s also attracted both violent attacks (being seen as indulgently bourgeois in the post-May 1968 context) and high acclaim. One writer who did praise  
_Les Enfants terribles_ was Truffaut, who wrote in 1974: ‘When this Cocteau-Melville film appeared in 1950, it was unlike anything else being done in French cinema at the time. There is no need to carefully distinguish what is Melville’s and what is Cocteau’s in this four-handed concerto; the former’s calm strength is well served by the latter’s spirited writing. The two artists worked together like Bach and Vivaldi. Jean Cocteau’s best novel became Jean-Pierre Melville’s best film.’<br>
