Drawing on extensive, sustained research carried out at the BFI National Archive, artist Holly Antrum presents a wide-ranging, unpredictable mix of film and videos, as if selected by the fictional researcher ‘Markéta’. Part-alternative voice, part-counterpoint for Antrum, ‘Markéta’ is imagined as a Czech student looking for elements of her country’s history in the Archive while pursuing an interest in the papers of film writer, director and academic Peter Wollen, which themselves map film history in complex, matrix-like shapes. This edition of the on-going Mixtape series takes the form of a lively, visual notebook, making unusual, texture-sensitive connections between the BFI National Archive and different personal and social histories.

**Markéta Hašková** (b. 1976, Brno, Czech Republic) is a fictional researcher comprised of multiple voices. She works as a translator, and she has travelled widely since living in London since 2002. Prior to the 1989 velvet revolution she planned to work in the family trade as a dressmaker. Hašková later studied film theory in the Faculty of Film and Television at the Academy of Performing Arts, Bratislava, graduating in 1999. From there she participated in the co-founding group behind 4 Elements film festival in Banská Štiavnica, Slovakia. Marketa’s self-directed research centred on the BFI National Archive, and fragmentary presence among DIY films, point to the intersection of subjectivity and material when looking into the anglophone film archive, and how this context frames and inflects that experience. From the BFI National Archive she is using the collection items of Peter Wollen’s notebooks as the primary source for a proposed synthetic, subjective and schematic index inspired by his interests, through which to traverse multiple histories. A background focus guides her approach, combining reflections on memories and experiences of adolescence during the fall of communism and 1990s transition era, understanding leftist feminist positionalities in different contexts, as well as her own – and editing audio visual material from the perspective of phonics and dramaturgy. Weaving-in the perspectives of a contested ‘post socialist’ and more recently ‘migrant’ identity within UK, she has begun to narrate a series of short personal essays. She has also kept a notebook charting schemas of social, cultural and film histories, and concepts of self – including film viewing notes, one part being published by Camera Austria in 2022 within the exhibition presented in Graz, _Laura Mulvey and Peter Wollen: Intersections in Theory, Film and Art_. She appears as a voice under-construction through online interviews with Czech and Slovak women and staged readings in a new film by artist and filmmaker Holly Antrum. Markéta is a matrilineal counterpart and the daughter of Holly Antrum’s mother by a different turn of history in 1948, and they are both British and Czech citizens. A book named after her will follow with Joan Publishing (UK) – release date to be announced.

**Peter Wollen** was born in London on 29 June 1938 and studied English at Christchurch College, Oxford. Both political journalist and film theorist, Wollen’s _Signs and Meaning in the Cinema_, first published in 1969, helped to transform the discipline of film studies by incorporating the methodologies of structuralism and semiotics.

Wollen’s first film credit was as co-writer of Michelangelo Antonioni’s _The Passenger_ (_Professione: Reporter_, Italy, 1975) and he made his debut as a director with _Penthesilea: Queen of the Amazons_ (1974), the first of six films co-written and co-directed with his wife, Laura Mulvey. The low-budget _Penthesilea_ portrayed women’s language and mythology as silenced by patriarchal structures. Acknowledging the influence of Godard’s _Le Gai Savoir_ (France, 1968), Wollen intended the film to fuse avant-garde and radically political elements. The resultant work is innovative in the context of British cinema history, although unsurprisingly its relentlessly didactic approach did not make for mass appeal.

For _Riddles of the Sphinx_ (1977), their most remarkable collaborative work, Wollen and Mulvey obtained a BFI Production Board grant, which enabled them to work with greater technical resources. Rewriting the Oedipal myth from a female standpoint, they use formal devices, such as their impressively choreographed circular pans, to create an expressionist effect which complicates and enhances the film’s narrative content.

_AMY!_ (1980), commemorating Amy Johnson’s solo flight from Britain to Australia, syntheses themes previously covered by Wollen and Mulvey, but it is unwieldy and deliberately ahistorical. More watchable is _Crystal Gazing_ (1982) in which formal experimentation is muted and narrative concerns emphasised. The film was criticised in some quarters for the absence of an explicitly feminist perspective, but it enjoyed generally favourable reviews. _Frida Kahlo and Tina Modotti_ (1982), a short film tied to an international art exhibition curated by Wollen, and _The Bad Sister_ (1982), a cumbersome drama based on a novel by Emma Tennant, were the final projects on which Wollen and Mulvey collaborated.

Wollen’s only solo feature, _Friendship’s Death_ (1987), was the bizarre and absorbing story of the relationship between a British war correspondent and a female extraterrestrial robot on a peace mission to Earth, who, missing her intended destination of MIT, lands inadvertently in Amman, Jordan during the events of ‘Black September’ 1970. The film’s intelligent wit, coupled with outstanding performances from Tilda Swinton and Bill Paterson, makes this Wollen’s most compelling film.

Wollen taught film at a number of universities and was chair of the Department of Film, Television and New Media at the University of California, Los Angeles.

Her work has been shown widely in the UK and internationally, in galleries, DIY spaces, cinemas, online and in print. Since 2018 she has been developing _Markéta’s Notes_. The project is also part of her PhD research with the BFI in partnership with Kingston School of Art, holding a scholarship funded by techne AHRC. Her films are distributed by LUX Artists’ Moving Image. She is based in London and South West England.

This Mixtape programme presents _Markéta’s (screen) Notes_ as part of this serial artwork and later-stage research project curated through the lens of Markéta and her  character development.
