A pair of estranged identical twins reunite after 18 years apart, having both fallen out over the same man. One is wealthy and the other is financially struggling, but any hope of a reconciliation is thwarted when buried secrets begin to emerge. Paul Henreid, Davis’ co-star from _Now, Voyager_, directs her in this crime drama, which sees Davis on top form playing twin sisters for the second time in her career (following _A Stolen Life_).

**Contemporary reviews**

Warner Brothers are to be congratulated on cashing in on Bette Davis’ personal success in _Baby Jane_ so quickly and so wholeheartedly. Admittedly the script has the air of being not so much tailored as run off an old, disused assembly-line. It is simply a rehash of Davis situations, and as such – since the actress is in fine professional form – an addict’s dream. The dual-identity basis comes from _A Stolen Life_, and does considerably more with it. Then there is the oppressive luxury mansion, superbly re-created down to the legged breakfast tray (_Mr. Skeffington_) and the black, high-necked, hobble-skirted nightgown complete with anti-sag face mask, forging signatures for the use of. There is the Davis kiss, body strained, eyes blazing with blank alarm (_Winter Meeting_); the metamorphosis from slouching frump to _soignée_ clothes-horse (_Now, Voyager_); the detailed adaptation of the coiffure; the bold lie to the police (_Marked Woman_ or _The Letter_); the silent, staring surveillance of a hated enemy’s death followed by the belated cry for help (_The Little Foxes_); the final, self-sacrificing irony (_Deception_), here aided discreetly by a butler inquiring what he should say at Madam’s trial. Most importantly, this is a rejuvenated Bette Davis, not a screeching harridan – the slender, straddling legs revered in at least one searching close-up, the mouth outlined in that familiar down-curving slash of defiance, the voice richly emphatic.

Mind you, Bette Davis has never experienced the slightest difficulty in taking melodrama in her stride. And in spite of the intelligence she brings to it, _Dead Ringer_ makes only too few demands on her as a serious actress. (Perhaps Damiani’s _The Empty Canvas_ will give her more scope.) Paul Henreid directs with smooth, impersonal, over-leisurely efficiency; the trick photography is excellent, and André Previn’s score celebrates each staircase-ascent with apt occasion. Though one regrets the absence of a co-star like Rains or Mary Astor strong enough for Miss Davis to strike sparks off (striking them off her own doppelgänger proves a shade exhausting after a while), there is a sterling rally of small-part support. Peter Lawford lashes out fearlessly as the lover, Karl Malden is a solid Sergeant Hobbson, and Estelle Winwood’s eye-rolling, skeletal matriarch reeks of lavender and creepy piety. As for Thor [the dog], from private golf green to private chapel he bestrides his mistress’s lushly carpeted world like a colossus.  
**_Monthly Film Bulletin_, May 1964**

When our American critic asked about ‘real movies’, he was challenged by a wicked and frivolous chorus of ‘What about _Dead Ringer_?’ Of course this preposterously nostalgic movie is simply a showcase for Bette Davis; and the fact that she has such extravagant fun with her dual role, skipping between seedy poverty on the wrong side of the tracks and upholstered grief in the mansion with the butler and the Great Dane and the private chapel, can be read as evidence of talent running to waste rather than talent fulfilled. The fact remains that a mixture of star quality, professionalism and a kind of zestful lunacy is too integral a part of Hollywood to be thrown on the scrap heap.  
It probably won’t come again. The news that Crawford, Davis, Astor and Moorehead are assembling for the Hollywood equivalent of an old-school reunion in _Hush ...Hush, Sweet Charlotte_ wakens some splendid echoes. Ungenerous though it may be to suggest it, a reunion in 30 years’ time of Sandra Dee, Hayley Mills, Tippi Hedren and Carroll Baker seems unlikely to carry quite the same charge.
