_+ Michelle Williams Gamaker in conversation with Dr Kulraj Phullar_

Michelle Williams Gamaker’s stunning, beautifully-staged films trouble the too often overlooked political dynamics trapped in classic cinema. Calling her work ‘fictional activism’, she imagines alternative scenarios where marginalised brown characters take control of the films in which they appear, reformulating narratives and disturbing received histories. _House of Women_ (2017) drastically reimagines casting sessions for Kanchi in _Black Narcissus_ in a deliberately dissonant, modern setting. _Thieves_ (2023) meanwhile sees rebellious Sabu and Anna May Wong turn the tables on Michael Powell and his crew, during the making of _The Thief of Baghdad_, with electrifying results.

We are delighted to also welcome Williams Gamaker to discuss her work, the issues it raises, and her interests in Powell and Pressburger, with Dr Kulraj Phullar.  
**William Fowler, bfi.org.uk**

**Michelle Williams Gamaker** is an artist filmmaker. Since 2014, she has been developing Fictional Activism: the restoration of marginalised film stars of colour as central figures, who return in her works as brown protagonists to challenge the fictional injustices to which they have been historically consigned.

By proposing critical alternatives to imperialist storytelling in British and Hollywood studio films, she interrogates cinema by sabotaging the casting process and utilising cinema’s tools against itself.

Williams Gamaker is joint winner of Film London’s Jarman Award (2020) and exhibits her films nationally and internationally, including BFI Flare (2017) and BFI London Film Festivals 2018, 2021, Aesthetica Short Film Festival (winner of Best Experimental Film, 2021 and 2023) London Short Film Festival (2022, 2024) and Sharjah Film Platform 6 (2023).

Williams Gamaker’s major institutional solo, _Our Mountains are Painted on Glass_ premiered _Thieves_, her first film in Fictional Revenge at South London Gallery.

It is currently on show at Dundee Contemporary Arts and will tour to Bluecoat, Liverpool in 2024.

She is a Reader in BA Fine Art at Goldsmiths College, University of London, and is currently a British Academy Wolfson Fellow, where she is developing her filmmaking as Critical Affection.

**Dr Kulraj Phullar** is a Film Studies scholar based in London. His areas of interest include classic Hollywood and film noir, British colonial and diasporic cinemas, and popular Indian cinemas.

He has taught at several universities and film schools, and currently works at MetFilm School in Ealing and as a guest tutor on the Film Studies, Programming and Curating MA at the National Film and Television School.
