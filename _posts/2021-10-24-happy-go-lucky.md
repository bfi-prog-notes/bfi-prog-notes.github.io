_+ Q&A with Mike Leigh and Alexis Zegerman_

Let me tell you something about teaching,’ snaps bitter, lost Scott (Eddie Marsan) to bubbly, glass-half-full Poppy (Sally Hawkins) in Mike Leigh’s new film _Happy-Go-Lucky_. Both are teachers of a sort: 30-year-old Poppy works at a local primary school while Scott is a driving instructor. But that’s where the similarities between these two Londoners end: their attitudes to life are worlds apart and they would be unlikely to meet if the confinement of a driving lesson had not thrust them together in a hermetic dramatic space comparable to the living rooms of Leigh films from _Bleak Moments_ (1971) through _Life Is Sweet_ (1990) to _Secrets & Lies_ (1996).  Put simply, Poppy sees the best in people, while Scott sees the worst.

The word is that _Happy-Go-Lucky_ is a departure for Leigh, a comedy that’s unashamedly optimistic. But that analysis only works on a superficial level and for those with short memories. Leigh himself, speaking to me about the film, is already tired of some of the more lazy reactions. ‘It’s said to be ‘extraordinary from this miserabilist’,’ he quotes, paraphrasing some of the reviews written when _Happy-Go-Lucky_ played at this year’s Berlin, where Sally Hawkins won the Silver Bear for acting. ‘To be honest, it’s so ludicrous that I’m beyond being cross about it.’

It’s true that _Happy-Go-Lucky_ offers a very different tone to Leigh’s two most recent films: _All or Nothing_ (2002), with its inherent sadness among the inhabitants of a crumbling London council estate, and _Vera Drake_ (2004), with its impression of an uptight 1950s London and the weight of a story hinged on unwanted pregnancy and illegal abortion. Yet one need only travel as far back as _Topsy-Turvy_ (1999), Leigh’s film about Gilbert and Sullivan and the dramatic process, to be reminded that for this director laughs do not emerge only from tragedy. More interesting, then, is to place the humour Leigh mines in _Happy-Go-Lucky_ in relation to that of his previous films. Compared with the often hysterical tone of his last explicit comedy _Life Is Sweet_, _Happy-Go-Lucky_ displays a more sophisticated and relaxed approach, with the serious and the funny more comfortable bedfellows. The gags are subtler and more often situational than based on peculiarities of character: compare the humour of the osteopathy scene or the flamenco lessons in _Happy-Go-Lucky_ with the laughs sought in _Life Is Sweet_ at the expense of the ridiculous Aubrey (Timothy Spall) with his warped Americanisms, sunglasses and baseball caps. Poppy is more fun than she is funny; she allows us to laugh but also to think.

But there are plenty of other affinities between _Happy-Go-Lucky_ and Leigh’s earlier work. There’s the ongoing concern with learning, whether formal or self-motivated, and with the attitudes of those involved professionally with the education or protection of others. There’s the interest in the suburbs. There’s the investigation of characters whose lives are invaded by other people. There’s the fascination with youth, and particularly with the borders between youth and responsibility. Even the awkward dynamic between Poppy and Scott recalls similarly incompatible relationships, from party-pooper Peter (Eric Allan) in _Bleak Moments_ bringing silence to the front-room gathering of Sylvia (Anne Raitt), to Edna Doré’s hunched and miserable Mrs Bender in _High Hopes_ (1988) being forced to sit in the gentrified kitchen of her vile upper-class neighbours after locking herself out. Such invasions are the stuff of Leigh’s continuing exploration of the various pushes and pulls at the ground level of British society.

What’s unusual about _Happy-Go-Lucky_ in Leigh’s oeuvre is that it shows a dominating interest in a single character, the force of whose personality drives the film. The obvious comparison is with _Naked_ (1993). If Leigh sees _Happy-Go-Lucky_ as ‘the reverse side of the same coin as _Naked’_, then the clearest reversal is of tone: the recent film gives a platform to Poppy’s optimism rather than to the pessimism and nihilism incarnated in Johnny. In _Naked_, Johnny asks Katrin Cartlidge’s Sophie, ‘Do you ever think you might have had the happiest moment in your entire life and all you’ve got to look forward to is sickness and purgatory?’ Whereas Poppy’s joyful idealism is captured in a heartfelt comment to her pupils: ‘It’d be amazing to fly, wouldn’t it?’ The differences are further emphasised by _Naked_’s dark palette and surfeit of night-time scenes as opposed to the visual ebullience of _Happy-Go-Lucky_, its vivid colours seemingly drawn from Poppy’s bright, loud dress sense.

That _Happy-Go-Lucky_ offers a central portrait within an ensemble cast is partly down to Leigh’s desire to work closely with Hawkins to build a story around her character. ‘It was about creating a character who would tap into her energy, humour and profundity,’ Leigh says, though he stresses that, ‘it’s still as much an ensemble piece as any of my films.’ Adds Leigh: ‘The only thing that makes this film unique is that, apart from two tiny scenes, there’s no parallel action. The entire action focuses on what’s happening to Poppy, whereas even in _Naked_ there’s a lot going on with other characters.’

Both _Naked_ and _Happy-Go-Lucky_ are emphatically urban films as opposed to the suburban likes of _Bleak Moments_, _Grown-Ups_ (1980), _Life Is Sweet_ and _Secrets & Lies_ or Leigh’s 1977 play _Abigail’s Party_. Yet Leigh doesn’t resist a familiar journey to the suburbs when Poppy, Zoe and Poppy’s youngest sister Suzy (Kate O’Flynn) drive to Southend-on-Sea to spend a day and night with Poppy’s younger, married and pregnant sister Helen (Caroline Martin). It’s the sort of expedition taken in _High Hopes_ by Cyril (Phil Davis) and Shirley (Ruth Sheen) to visit his social-climbing sister Valerie (Heather Tobias), or in _Meantime_ (1983) by unemployed Cohn (Tim Roth) to do jobs for his richer aunt Barbara (Marion Bailey) away from the squalor of the east London estate where he lives. Such trips to the edge of town are a source of unease for Leigh that allows him to explore issues of unequal wealth and happiness, often within the same family and between siblings.

The conflict Leigh explores when Poppy visits Helen is less about class or wealth than about ideas of how to live life at a certain age. Here the perennial concept of ‘the done thing’ raises its ugly head. Helen thinks that Poppy is not living responsibly enough for her age, and says so. It’s a measure of Poppy’s character – strong, independent and resistant to crippling outside influences – that she stands up for herself: ‘I love my life. Yeah, it can be hard at times, but that’s part of it.’

But perhaps we shouldn’t get too carried away by Poppy’s effervescent nature and permanent smile. For there are suggestions that not everything is as rosy as the colourful jewellery she wears. Should we detect in Poppy anything of the brave-face-in-adversity displayed by other characters over the years, most notably Beverly in _Abigail’s Party_? Significantly, once Poppy embarks on a romance in the later stages of the film she loses some of her excessive make-up and baubles, indicating that perhaps she now no longer feels the need to try so hard. And there’s an important late-night scene with a troubled tramp where we may come closest to witnessing her essence. As the tramp stutters drunkenly at her, indicating his own trauma,

Poppy reacts with striking intuition, nodding and agreeing. ‘You know?’ he asks, stumbling to a halt. ‘Yeah, I do,’ says Poppy with an empathy that suggests real understanding. Does her refusal to share the details of this encounter with her friends hint that Poppy is hiding a buried unhappiness she doesn’t fully comprehend? Certainly it’s an episode that shines new light on her scenes of comic banter, as at the osteopath’s surgery where she deflects her pain with a stream of gags.

Some of Leigh’s films are explicitly of the moment: _Meantime_ investigates early-1980s unemployment; the television play _Four Days in July_ (1984) focuses on the Northern Irish religious divide; _High Hopes_ riffs on the fading flame of socialism;  _Life Is Sweet_ draws attention to the absurdities of Thatcherite entrepreneurialism.  But there are others where the sense of contemporaneity is more ingrained in the characters, their attitudes and their relations to the people around them.  _Happy-Go-Lucky_ belongs to this category: we have to step back from the story to consider what Poppy’s character and behaviour say about the zeitgeist. She’s a modern, urban woman, as comfortable with her friends as with her family, able to balance pleasure with work, and confident in being single while retaining romantic ideals. Leigh teases the political out of the personal. ‘I don’t think _Happy-Go-Lucky_ is any less political than my other films,’ he insists. ‘It’s as much about dealing with life and coping with issues as anything I’ve made.’
