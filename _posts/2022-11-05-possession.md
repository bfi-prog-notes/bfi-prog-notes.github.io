**SPOILER WARNING The following notes give away some of the plot.**

Part divorce drama, part creature feature, part Cold War thriller, _Possession_ is one of the most unsettling films of all time. With his marriage on the brink of collapse, Mark (Neill) tries desperately to cling on to his wife Anna (Adjani) as she indulges in her affairs with men… and other beings. Adjani’s commitment to her performance pushed her to her limits, and she is as magnetic as it is unhinged in the role of a woman on the verge of a cosmic breakdown.

Anyone who’s heard of Andrzej Zulawski will probably recall him as the Polish director who made _Possession_, in which Sam Neill and Isabelle Adjani screamed at one another for two hours. Sadly _Possession_ is the only Zulawski film to have had substantial distribution in Britain (even enjoying a brief moment of notoriety as an early ‘video nasty’) – though the 11 features the director has turned out in a quarter of a century have all displayed an invigorating camera style, a boldly emotional approach to acting and a challenging set of concerns and obsessions that make him without question an _auteur_. Love him or loathe him, Zulawski makes exciting, indelible cinema that cries out for wider critical examination.

Consider _Possession_ for a start. Set in a divided Berlin, the film begins with Marc (Neill) returning home to his wife (Adjani) to find their relationship crumbling for reasons neither can articulate. Marc holes up in a hotel room and spirals into mental decline, so what ensues could arguably be seen as the distorted viewpoint of a man in deep psychosis. Gradually Marc establishes that Anna has a lover, Heinrich (extravagantly incarnated by Heinz Bennent), whose trendy Eastern mysticism and bisexual posturing leads the offended husband to ridicule him at every opportunity. But Anna evidently has another lover, and Marc sets a private detective agency on her trail. Following her to a bare apartment just by the Wall, the detective finds her in the company of a dark, slimy tentacular creature (it is revealed to us four times in the film, on each occasion assuming a more human form). This leap into the fantastic is prepared for by the pervasive air of dementia already surrounding the characters, especially Anna, who is prone to violent outbursts and uncontrollable fits. Rarely has the porcelain beauty of Adjani been turned to better effect, as her demeanour shifts constantly from angelic purity to demonic intensity.

With Anna away from home, Marc takes their son Bob to school and encounters a gentle teacher, Helen, whom he gradually accepts into the house. She is also played in the film by Adjani – so Anna’s splintering personality is directly manifested by Helen ‘acting’ as the caring mother Anna once was. The Anna whom Marc still desires repeatedly describes her own feelings of disassociation. She has found an implacable dark side in herself, disturbingly manifested in a 16mm movie made by Heinrich that Marc watches, in which she tortures a young ballerina in class to sustain a painful position until the girl runs off screaming. This remarkable sequence is only just topped by _Possession_’s most notorious scene, in which a truly ‘possessed’ Anna has a fit in the subway, flies into a ferocious dance of death and, oozing bodily fluids from every orifice, miscarries something glutinous that is left undefined. This for me exceeds anything thrown up by _The Exorcist_ for sheer impact on the nervous system.

Zulawski pushes the narrative into even wilder territory in the final scenes, in which Marc becomes a fugitive from the cops investigating the trail of deaths related to Anna’s creature. After a chase, he lies bleeding on a staircase and is unexpectedly approached by Anna, who announces that the creature is now ‘finished’, revealing it to be a perfect replica of Marc. While the ‘real’ Anna and Marc die in the ensuing police fusillade, the new Marc makes his escape to turn up at the family home to confront Helen. Bob repeatedly screams ‘Don’t open the door’ and runs into the bathroom to drown himself in the tub. While white light invades the apartment to the sound of a war starting up (sirens, bombs, gunfire), Helen stares at us in a trance, with the figure of Marc (or Marc 2, if you like) pressed against the glass door.

Zulawski’s stated aim was to take the stuff of soap opera and push it up a few notches, and for a spectator prepared to make that journey, the power of his direction lies in his conviction that cinema occupies an imaginative space in which energy and emotion at full throttle will _make_ you believe. _Possession_ is a film about the desire for married partners to possess each other, to know each other, and how that desire taken to neurotic extremes results in the unleashing of a suppressed, demonic side. The city in which the film is set is a deserted one, appropriate to the mental state of characters oblivious to anyone with whom they have no direct emotional involvement. It falls into place that they should then see doubles everywhere, reflections in others of what has become an obsessive quest. But in manifesting the hidden recesses of the imagination, a future chaos may result, beyond our worst nightmares.
