**Red Ensign**  
In his twelfth film in four years, Michael Powell directed his own story of an ambitious shipbuilder, David Barr (Leslie Banks), and his attempt to turn around the fortunes of the British shipping industry during the depression of the 1930s. Visionary and uncompromising – and not afraid to break the rules – Barr can be seen as the first of a number of Powell’s screen alter-egos, who would include Eric Portman’s Colpeper in _A Canterbury Tale_ (1944) and Roger Livesey’s Dr Reeves in _A Matter of Life and Death_ (1946), and culminate in his own appearance in _Peeping Tom_ (1960). Like Colpeper, Barr is a morally complex hero, who is prepared to commit fraud in order to overcome the opposition of his narrow-minded colleagues.

With a campaigning tone which would become familiar in his wartime dramas such as _49th Parallel_ (1941) and _One of Our Aircraft Is Missing_ (1942), _Red Ensign_ (1934) was one of the director’s favourites of his early works. The film’s attitude to labour relations – a trade union activist is exposed as a plant representing an unscrupulous rival, and the workers are expected to go without pay for the good of the company – adds some weight to critic Raymond Durgnat’s claim that Powell represented ‘High Tory’ values. At the same time, the film draws on the work of the Soviet master Sergei Eisenstein in its romanticism of industry.

Made for Gaumont-British as a ‘quota quickie’, the film has been read as a plea for intervention to develop the British film industry, as well as a kind of manifesto for Powell’s kind of cinema, challenging the emerging documentary movement. As Powell himself put it: ‘It was the first time that Michael Powell himself realised that there was something special about a Michael Powell film, something going on on the screen, or behind the screen, which you couldn’t put your finger on, something intriguing, aloof, but in the long run memorable.’

The ﬁlm starts with a montage of idle shipyards and a ﬂurry of written titles: ‘For over 200 years the British Mercantile Marine has carried the Red Ensign to every port in the world. Today many of our ships lie idle for want of cargoes. Shipyards are deserted. The distress flag is ﬂying. This is the story of David Barr, shipbuilder, and his ﬁght to bring back prosperity to British ships’. The ﬁlm thus announces a strategy in strong contrast to that of John Grierson’s celebrated documentary movement, which was likewise concerned with social issues and with imperial trade (it was initially sponsored by the Empire Marketing Board) but which distrusted the use of the personal story to carry a propaganda message. In turn, Michael Powell was never slow to express his dislike of documentary methods and of the documentary hegemony in British ﬁlm culture, and _Red Ensign_ bears this out in the purposeful way it uses a triangular love affair to resolve its political story: David Barr ﬁghts the cautious businessman Lord Dean, both for the affections of heiress June MacKinnon, and for the use of her money to ﬁnance his construction programme.

Powell pointedly gives a minor character the name of Grierson and has him pointed out as ‘the best riveter in the yard’. The ﬁlm has some strong documentary footage, put together in a style that evokes Soviet montage, but is not afraid of embracing the theatrical in terms of sets and acting style. This blend, and the strong crusading tone of the ﬁlm, preﬁgure the distinctive kind of patriotic work Powell would do in wartime in partnership with Emeric Pressburger, in ﬁlms like _49th Parallel_ (1941) and _A Canterbury Tale_ (1944). _Red Ensign_ is of equal interest as an early Powell ﬁlm and as a document of 1934, one which now seems to be as much about the British cinema as about British shipping. Barr campaigns to have the Board of Trade impose a quota on the shipping industry: this will support British shipbuilding by compelling British ship owners to buy a minimum proportion of their ﬂeets from British yards. It is precisely the mechanism which the Board had been applying to the ﬁlm industry since the Films Act of 1921 in the face of powerful opposition from many exhibitors and distributors. When Barr speaks out against the short-sightedness of his board’s policy of ‘internationalism’, he is told that ‘we’re here to discuss business, not patriotism’, and replies that ‘patriotism is good business, can’t you see that?’ In the words of Geoff Brown (_Monthly Film Bulletin_, September 1981): ‘the temptation to equate Barr’s struggle to make an all-British ship with the emerging work of Powell (and indeed Michael Balcon, his executive producer) is irresistible’.

**The Night of the Party**  
By 1933 the partnership of director Michael Powell and producer Jerry Jackson had made nine bona ﬁde ‘quota-quickies’, some of which had even been favourably received by the critics, and also by producers who, however, were chieﬂy impressed, in John Russell Taylor’s words, by ‘… his professionalism in bringing in his ﬁlms on time and within their tiny budgets.’ On the strength of these, they obtained a contract to make four ﬁlms for Gaumont British, then run by Michael Balcon, who later became better known for his running of Ealing studios in the ’40s and ’50s. It and British International Pictures were at that time the two biggest companies in the British ﬁlm industry, so this was a considerable step up for Powell and Jackson.

The team was meant to provide its own scripts and shoot them for a cost of around £12,000. In the event they only wrote two of their own ﬁlms, _The Fire Raisers_ and _The Red Ensign_, which were book-ended by two scripts based on stage plays which were released as _The Night of the Party_ and _The Phantom Light_.

_The Fire Raisers_ was the ﬁrst of the four ﬁlms to be released by Gaumont, but _The Night of the Party_ was actually completed ﬁrst: according to Powell, its release was held up because it was too short, and so three days’ worth of extra scenes were shot after Banks and Powell completed their next project. Based on a play with the prototypical title of _Murder Party_ (which was used for the American release of the ﬁlm), the ﬁlm is a whodunnit in which an after dinner game of ‘murder’ turns deadly shortly after all the lights are turned out. Needless to say, most of the guests have a good reason for hating the victim.

_The Night of the Party_ is a most theatrical piece; in fact it practically never sets foot outside the studio, with the majority of the action conﬁned to only four sets. To make it visually interesting Powell and his American cinematographer Glen MacWilliams used a number of shots with mirrors, to make the angles more unusual and more efﬁcient. The party itself is well handled, and the scenes in the dark for the ‘Murder’ game are atmospherically photographed, while Muriel Aked steals most of her scenes in her humorous portrayal of the Princess Amelia of Corsova(!). Powell was ﬂattered to be offered a piece with a cast that included Malcolm Keen, Ian Hunter, Leslie Banks and Ernest Thesiger (as the wonderfully named ‘Adrian Chiddiatt’) who all give good value for money. None the less he later remembered it as ‘a bad ﬁlm from a bad script, from a very poor play and not very successful’, and although it only got respectful reviews, the ﬁlm represents several important ‘ﬁrsts’ for Powell. It was the ﬁrst of the three ﬁlms Leslie Banks made for him at Gaumont (he would later also appear in _The Small Back Room_); it was also the ﬁrst of four ‘quickies’ that he made starring Ian Hunter (who later turned up in _The Battle of the River Plate_); it was also the ﬁrst contact that Powell had with Art Director Alfred Junge, with whom he would later work on seven ﬁlms and who would play a crucial role in the distinctive visual style of Powell’s work as one half of the Archers with Emeric Pressburger.
