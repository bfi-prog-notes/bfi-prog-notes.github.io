Wong Kar Wai’s impressive debut feature may seem like a conventional Hong Kong triad drama on the surface but it offers glimpses of what would become his distinctive signature style. This atmospheric tale of a disillusioned gangster (Andy Lau) torn between a new love (Maggie Cheung) and old loyalties was  a more reflective take on the popular genre, mixing brutal action with  stylish flourishes.<br>

Wong Kar Wai’s world of heartbreak and melancholy is defined by sumptuous visuals and elliptical storytelling. Yet just as vital is his use of music.  
His frequent incorporation of songs from around the world – of vintage pop, romantic ballads, traditional music and easy listening – is just as specific as his visual focus on abstraction and sensation.

The multicultural sounds of his films evoke a sense of the past, often conjuring memories as his lonely, heartbroken characters dream of potential connections or ones they once had. He pulls from a history of popular and traditional music as well as a history of cinema soundtracks, including – in one instance – a theme borrowed from another film.

Wong’s debut feature is his most generic, an 80s Hong Kong crime film cut from the template established by directors such as Ringo Lam and John Woo. But his signature touches shine through in the doomed love story between Ah Ngor (Maggie Cheung) and Wah (Andy Lau), particularly in a moment involving the film’s biggest needle drop. That would be Sandy Lam’s Cantopop cover of Giorgio Moroder and Berlin’s original song for _Top Gun_ (1986), ‘Take My Breath Away’. Wong wrings genuine emotion out of the overwrought ballad, the corny lyrics managed by the film’s melancholy.

The song fits in snugly among the other 80s synthpop cues, including songs from the film’s own Andy Lau (himself and co-star Jacky Cheung, who plays his triad brother, are both known as part of the ‘Four Heavenly Kings of Cantopop’). Lau’s power ballad ‘Chi Xin Cuo Fu’ is reprised at key moments in Wah’s struggle to save his brother.<br>

Wong Kar Wai’s debut feature conspicuously lacks the gorgeous colours and stylised _mise en scène_ of such later offerings as _In the Mood for Love_ and _2046_. It’s a straightforward gangland thriller, loosely based on _Mean Streets_, though the very bloody action sequences are handled with genuine flair.

Wong throws in some of the slow-motion sequences for which he would later become famous while portraying the relationship between hoodlum Andy Lau and his renegade brother with both humour and pathos.<br>

Watching a Wong Kar Wai film means entering a world of heightened emotions. It’s not just that they tell unforgettable stories of ill-fated romance, but it’s the masterful way the Hong Kong auteur draws you in ever so tantalisingly. Dreamlike textures, vivid colours and evocative music weave a potent atmosphere that leaves you completely hypnotised.

As a director obsessed with the heart-pounding thrill of seduction, he knows exactly how to beguile his audience just as mesmerisingly. His haunting mood pieces enchant the senses – it’s the closest you’ll get to experiencing the exhilarating rush of falling in love while at the cinema.

As a young boy, who moved with his family from Shanghai to Hong Kong in 1962, Wong spent most of his time with his mother, an avid film buff, in the cinema. ‘We spent almost every day watching films – French films, Hollywood films, Italian films, films from Taiwan and local productions,’ he said at 2017’s Lumière Festival. ‘This was sort of my film school, my education.’

His wide-ranging influences became apparent once he started directing.  His moody feature debut, _As Tears Go By_ (1988), earned comparisons to Martin Scorsese’s _Mean Streets_ (1973), while _Chungking Express_ (1994) channelled the unconventional spirit of Jean-Luc Godard’s _Breathless_ (1960). Wong’s mentor Patrick Tam had an impact too on his neon-drenched  visual palette.

Wong, a former TV scriptwriter, was also inspired by literature, particularly the works of Haruki Murakami, Liu Yichang and Gabriel García Márquez. But the novelist who had the biggest impact on him was Manuel Puig. The Argentinian author’s writing style – stories told in fragments using multiple points of view – shaped Wong’s own narrative technique.

The director took these interests and turned them into something completely unique with his deeply profound and soul-stirring stories of love, alienation and heartbreak. Wong found international acclaim, winning the best director prize at 1997’s Cannes Film Festival for _Happy Together_, because he was a pioneer who created his own cinematic language for romance, one that was swooningly lyrical and visually stunning. He made the torment of our inner thoughts seem sexy, poetic and glamorous.<br>
