**A contemporary review**  
Given the current fashion for remakes, together with the bubbling revival of German film production, it’s to be expected that the _Caligari_ era, stretching gloriously from Rye’s _Student of Prague_ to Lang’s _Testament of Dr Mabuse_, will in due time prove a fertile landscape for cinematic rediscovery. Metropolis could rise again, with pauses for industrial inaction; Kriemhild could wreak a multimillion-dollar revenge, and there could be a punk-disco version of _Alraune_. But Murnau’s _Nosferatu_, in 1922 just about at the heart of German expressionism, is unarguably a special case in that its protagonist shows every sign of remaining permanently undead. Rediscovery is unnecessary; Dracula and his acolytes continue to stalk both stage and screen in rude vitality. That Werner Herzog, an original even among a generation of originals, should choose to unleash the Count upon us yet again, suggests an exercise in futility rather than of inspiration.

In its defence, Herzog’s _Nosferatu the Vampyre_ is concerned not with Bram Stoker but with F.W. Murnau, a homage rarely enough attempted (Godard and Chabrol have paid their respects, but few besides) and never before in the context of _Nosferatu_ (_pace_ the Professor of that name in _Alphaville_). Herzog’s first step has been the reincarnation of Murnau’s vampire, as ineradicably portrayed by Max Schreck, in Klaus Kinski’s superb make-up – the same bulging dome above the hollow, sleepless gaze and attenuated front teeth, the same obscene spray of fingernails, the same reptilian glide punctuated by bursts of superhuman energy. Scene after scene constructed around this appalling figure is simply Murnau with colour and sound: the abrupt assault on a paralysed Jonathan Harker, the unhurried voyage of the plague ship, the vampire’s choking collapse by the window at sunrise. The warning shadows of the expressionists patrol once more the walls of the stricken town (formerly Bremen, now Delft in Holland), and the sepulchral cloak and hat of Caligari himself can be briefly glimpsed outside the Harker home. More subtly, Herzog is perfectly attuned to Murnau’s symphony of landscapes, which Lotte Eisner has linked with the spectacular harmonies of Dovzhenko’s work; echoing them both, Herzog’s _Nosferatu_ is a celebration of rolling hills and mists, majestic forests, and the customary turbulence of cascading rivers. When night falls amid this impervious splendour, Herzog reverently allows it to take its time – although dawn, one must admit, is by contrast startlingly brisk.

The story, of course, is another matter. Few spines will be chilled these days by the festive scene, rendered so familiar by Bray Studios, in which Harker speaks the name of Dracula at the local hostelry and the innkeeper’s wife promptly drops some crockery. Herzog almost, but not quite, decides to play it for laughs, and the uncertainty flows on into later scenes so that, for instance, the Count’s excessive interest in the cut on his guest’s hand comes perilously close to music-hall melodrama in which everyone knows the script. All the conventions are observed, from the close-ups of a flying bat to the stygian coach-and-four, from the punctured neck-wounds to the spectacle of Dracula reposing in his tomb. Through Isabelle Adjani’s performance, moreover, Herzog follows the choreography of high tragedy – the arms limply extended in farewell, the eyes and mouth gaping in oval horror at a nightmare, the decorous faint on the doorstep when the returned husband fails to recognise her. It’s carefully, consistently and courageously mannered, but it goes unsupported by the other performances; Bruno Ganz (as Harker) has a conscientious anonymity, Jacques Dufilho admirably underplays his role as the doomed ship’s captain, while Roland Topor is allowed to go way over the top as Dracula’s lunatic disciple. The collision of styles provides, as so often in Herzog’s films, a special kind of tension, but it creates of _Nosferatu_, unlike the Murnau, or for that matter the Terence Fisher versions, a series of cameos, some successful, some not.

It’s when he strays furthest away from Murnau that Herzog is at his most interesting. The disintegration of the town as the plague takes its toll, with Lucy Harker wandering distractedly through the macabre celebrations and being invited by half the production crew to join their Last Supper, is presented with an urgency that supports Herzog’s press statement about it being ‘no accident that I make this film now.’ (Occasionally he retreats to a rooftop, gazing speculatively down at the processions of coffins, but he quickly returns to the heart of the matter – the collapse of a smug and stifling bourgeois community, in which the sacrifice of a girl in order to destroy the plague-carrier is meaningful more as an act of loving acceptance than as the rejection of evil).

From Murnau’s images, Herzog creates his own: the magnificent staging of the plague ship taking aboard its deadly cargo, and the helicopter shot of its course across a placid sea; the return of Jonathan Harker, borne by coach between two canals as if marooned in perpetuity; the macabre comedy of Van Helsing’s arrest as, bloody stake in hand, he is apprehended by a reluctant citizen who doubts (with good reason) whether the due processes of law have survived; the brief, astounding glimpse, straight out of _Aguirre_, of a raft laden with coffins being swept down a torrential river. Finally, _Nosferatu_ shows the plague-carrier galloping across sand-flats on his endless, lethal journey, his continuity praised by a reverential choir on the soundtrack; Herzog finds both image and concept equally glorious.

It’s a conclusion that confirms the reason behind the remake – the reprise is not of Murnau but of Herzog. Dracula is an outsider like Kaspar Hauser, Stroszek and Aguirre, a death-seeker amid the troops of somnambulists. Invading Holland with his conquistadorial rats, he bears a priceless gift, as promised by all true prophets – the knowledge of how not to die. There’s just one catch: eternal life, secured through the sharing of blood, has its disadvantages. Kinski’s voice conveys them superbly by its despairing weariness. ‘Can you imagine,’ he murmurs hopelessly, ‘what it’s like to endure centuries of experiencing the same futile things?’ Such is the continuing fatalism of Werner Herzog, continuing to revolve in an elegant solitude.
