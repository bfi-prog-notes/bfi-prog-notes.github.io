_+ Q&A with director Andrew Haigh and actor Sir Tom Courtenay (in person) plus live via Zoom, actors Colin Farrell and Jack O’Connell. Hosted by broadcaster  
and critic Rhianna Dhillon._

Adapted for the screen and directed by Andrew Haigh, _The North Water_ features Jack O’Connell as Patrick Sumner, Colin Farrell as Henry Drax, and Stephen Graham as Captain Brownlee, alongside Tom Courtenay as Baxter. _The North Water_ also stars Peter Mullan, Sam Spruell and Roland Møller.

Set in Hull and on the ice floes of the Arctic in the late 1850s, _The North Water_’s location work took place primarily in the Arctic, shooting on the frozen seas north of the Svalbard Archipelago. The cast and production team sailed as far as 81 degrees north to film sequences in the pack ice, the furthest point north it is believed a drama series has ever filmed before.

Based on the acclaimed novel by Ian McGuire, the five-part series tells the story of Patrick Sumner (O’Connell), a disgraced ex-army surgeon who signs up as ship’s doctor on a whaling expedition to the Arctic. But the ferocity of the elements is matched by the violence of his crew mates, with Drax (Farrell), a harpooner and distinctly brutal force of nature. As the true purpose of the expedition becomes clear, confrontation between the two men erupts, taking them on a journey far from solid ground and beyond the safe moorings of civilisation.

Commissioned by the BBC, _The North Water_ is made by See-Saw Films.  
Executive producers are Jamie Laurenson, Hakan Kousetta, Iain Canning and Emile Sherman for See-Saw Films, Niv Fichman for Rhombus Media, and  
Jo McClellan for the BBC. The series was produced by Kate Ogborn. _The North Water_ is a co-production with Rhombus Media and is distributed internationally  by BBC Studios.

_The North Water_ will air on BBC Two and BBC iPlayer this autumn.

The film premiered at the Cannes Film Festival along with Sofia Coppola’s _The_ _Beguiled_, in which he also starred with Nicole Kidman, Elle Fanning, and Kirsten Dunst.
