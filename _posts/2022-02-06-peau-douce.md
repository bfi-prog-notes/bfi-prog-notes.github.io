**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away the film’s ending.

Truffaut’s _La Peau douce_ was greeted with a certain coolness at Cannes. Was it really understood? The film is about an editor of a literary review, Pierre Lachenay, who falls in love with an air hostess while attending a conference in Portugal. Back in Paris, he quarrels with his wife; then a literary gathering at Rheims offers an opportunity to take the girl to the country. For a time she is impressed, but his fretting anxiety about what people will say makes her decide to leave him, just as he makes up his mind and offers to marry her. Suggested by a news item, the story ends in tragedy: he is shot in a crowded restaurant, and the wife is revenged.

The feeling was that Truffaut had sunk back into the conventional cinema which he once lashed so unmercifully, to make a film which might bear the signature of any old Bernstein-brand playwright. _La Peau douce_, however, is a trap: there have been plenty of films about adultery, but few have ventured to take the mechanism so methodically to pieces. And Truffaut’s characters can hardly be called conventional. Behind Lachenay’s air of calm competence lurks indecision, weakness, diffidence (a diffidence close to that of _Tirez sur le Pianiste_, and one of the secret keys to Truffaut’s world). The wife, normally presented as a resigned, mousy compendium of domestic virtues, is here alluring, voluptuous, eminently desirable, offering herself to her husband with the utmost provocation, her animal cries of pain etching in a striking portrait of a woman in love. Her final scene, after she has killed her husband, is unforgettable: amid the uproar of the restaurant she throws away the gun, sinks down, turns up the collar of her raincoat as if the chill of prison were already on her, and the terrible ghost of a smile flickers on her lips. Pierre, now, belongs to her. Equally unconventional, the other woman is not the man-eating vamp of tradition, but a young girl, a charmingly unripe peach flattered to find herself not only noticed but wanted. She talks, however, endlessly, all about her family; she isn’t terribly interested in money; and she says she won’t mind too much if they can’t make love for a month or two.

Another accusation: ‘It’s a documentary about the gear-changes of the Citroen.’ But the extreme fragmentation of _La Peau douce_, the ellipses, the quantity of extremely brief shots, are a sort of _pointillisme_ in the direction, adding fascinating layers to the texture of the film. Truffaut is obviously an admirer of _Muriel_ (the editing, the stress laid on meals, on sudden switches in light), and the influence of Resnais has deepened both the frontiers of his world and his style, taking him far beyond the eternal rapid panning of the days of _Les Quatre cents coups_. The fragmented surface is matched by breaks in rhythm, and _La Peau douce_ is a subtle exercise in varying perspectives – in closeness and distance (Desailly’s glasses), in hesitations and sudden rushes forward – with which Truffaut, like Resnais, addresses himself across his actors to the spectator in a quest for some enduring quality in happiness. Through his use of disconnection (light switches, camera shutters, gear-changes), Truffaut demonstrates the fragility of love; his world is one of objects and skins, of fleeting glances and fleeting contacts, as though love, in the steely world in which we live, were no more than two skins touching in a universe where things and people are sealed away from each other in impenetrable envelopes.

There is still much of the old Truffaut in _La Peau douce_, in the quotations from Renoir, from himself, and the _Tirez_-style baroque couplets, but a new, mature Truffaut is revealed. To the qualities which we already know, his freshness, charm, delicacy and reserve, a new deliberation has been added, a sense of balance, an ability to construct his film round those key scenes in which he reveals himself most fully: the sequence in the aircraft with the hostess drawing a curtain to change her shoes; the wonderful scene of furtive glances in the lift, followed by Lachenay’s exhilaration in his room, switching on all the lights one after another, then fumbling with the wrong key in the lock; the crumpled telegram; the mistress being jealous of the wife; the little girl trying on her mother’s shoes; the kitten on the breakfast tray; the girl dancing, changing her jeans at a petrol station, having to be told ‘Not so loud’ at the restaurant, and last seen from the top of a block of unfinished flats as she disappears for ever. A snapshot in a viewfinder, the whirr of a delayed-action shutter heard over the wife’s discovery of the photographs. These are some of the new departures in the film.

The weaknesses are self-evident. There is a certain lack of conviction in the background details of an intellectual who directs an avant-garde review from an attic but lives the private life of a big businessman; and rather than the final shooting _à Ia_ Godard, I would have preferred an ending which left Lachenay abandoned by both women. But these faults are small. The film shows what Truffaut could have achieved (and will achieve) with a trio of actors as fine as Françoise Dorleac. Jean Desailly and Nelly Benedetti are excellent, but Françoise Dorleac reaches beyond mere performance. One would swear that Truffaut had talked the role over endlessly with her, injecting it piece by piece, shaping gradually until the character herself took over, inventing her own dialogue and living the film as it went along. After the glittering lightning flashes of _Jules et Jim_, Truffaut has here made, in a film about adultery, his first adult film.<br>
