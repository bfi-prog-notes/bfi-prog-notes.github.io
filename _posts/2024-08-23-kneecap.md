The BT Tower looms over the London neighbourhood of Fitzrovia, casting its shadow like the gnomon of a sundial, a middle finger to the spires of Hawksmoor and Wren that puncture the sky above the city, a signal that telecommunications are now the closest thing we have to God.

The streets below, north of Oxford Street, west of Bloomsbury, once home to Virginia Woolf and George Bernard Shaw, once the London of _Peeping Tom_ (1960) and _Phantom Thread_ (2017), now abuzz with static as the prêt-à-porter suits and dresses of adland rub against the creased plaid shirts emerging from another post-production all-nighter.

The literary history of the area lives on in the pubs. On Rathbone Street, the Marquis of Granby is an old haunt of T.S. Eliot; the Newman Arms was the model for the pub in George Orwell’s _Nineteen Eighty-Four_; and one night in the Duke of York, Anthony Burgess peered nervously over his pint as the place was torn apart by a local gang. And in this most English of areas imaginable in a cosmopolitan city, where a portrait of Prince Andrew in military regalia hangs above the side entrance to the site of the alleged inspiration for the ultraviolence in Burgess’s _A Clockwork Orange_, we meet Kneecap, a three-piece group from Belfast who rap in Irish and cause controversy and excitement wherever they go.

Comprising rappers Móglaí Bap (‘I respect the commitment to still have Prince Andrew up there. They must really like him…’) and Mo Chara (‘It just goes to show they can do anything. There’s no morality when it comes to the royal family…’) alongside producer DJ Próvaí, Kneecap have become as talked about for their outspoken support for a united Ireland and free Palestine as they have for their music, a heady mix of hip hop and rave that hit the mainstream this summer with two of the most talked-about sets at Glastonbury.

The group star as semi-fictionalised versions of themselves alongside Michael Fassbender, Simone Kirby and Josie Walker in _Kneecap_, the feature debut of Rich Peppiatt, which won the NEXT audience prize at this year’s Sundance, the first time an Irish-language film had screened at the festival. A cartoonified retelling of the band’s origin story, _Kneecap_ is fast, funny and thrillingly political. Set during the marches and protests that helped push through the Identity and Language Act 2022, which offers official recognition for and protection of the Irish language in Northern Ireland, the film positions Mo Chara and Móglaí Bap as erudite working-class hopefuls looking for an outlet for their frustrations and rage. They find their voice through rap, as natural a home for protest music as punk or folk, the clichéd depiction of unintelligent boys in tracksuits as the butt of the joke pointedly absent.

Obvious comparisons with _Trainspotting_ (1996) can be drawn through the film’s animated sequences, hyper-realistic Class A experiences and a pulsating soundtrack that adds urgency and jeopardy, while the liberal reimagining of the real lives of its musical subjects allows comparison with _A Hard Day’s Night_ (1964) and _8 Mile_ (2002). Where the film stays true to life is in the band’s advocacy of the Irish language and their fire-starting approach to making the world sit up and listen.

Kneecap first gained notoriety in 2019 after the UK press picked up on the story of a Belfast rap group leading a chant of ‘Get your Brits out’ (also the name of one of their tracks) at a pub Prince William and Kate Middleton had visited in the city the previous day. In August 2022, ahead of their then-biggest show at a festival in West Belfast they unveiled a mural of a burning police car, tagged ‘Ní l fáilte roimh an RUC’ (The RUC – Royal Ulster Constabulary – aren’t welcome). A month later, when the Queen of England died, they tweeted: ‘As head of the British Army she oversaw dozens of wars & the deaths of millions. Belfast to Baghdad, Libya to the Malvinas. There’s a thousand crimes behind the crown.’ They were awarded a publicly-funded arts grant, approved by an independent selection board, which was rescinded by the then secretary of state for business and trade, Kemi Badenoch, on the grounds that the UK should not fund ‘people that oppose the United Kingdom itself’. Kneecap were granted permission to challenge the ruling by the high court in Belfast. A full hearing will take place in November. They’ve posed for photos with Gerry Adams, Jeremy Corbyn and, most recently, the usually reticent Cillian Murphy, a music fan and supporter of a united Ireland. In every picture, as on stage, DJ Próvaí wears a provocative Irish tricolour balaclava.

Director Rich Peppiatt is keen to make sure I understand the cultural significance of Kneecap. ‘These boys have had such a massive impact,’ he says. ‘Particularly on young people engaging with the Irish language. Language has got this thing of not being cool, and to have three people who are speaking Irish who young people can look up to, who’ve made the language cool, it’s really not an underestimation to say that a significant portion of young people who are engaging with the Irish language now do so because of Kneecap. And they’ve done that not because they’re trying to do it, but because naturally that’s who they are. They’re doing their own thing, living their lives as Irish speakers, and I think it’s very special. They’ve managed to have that impact in a way that really does transcend the music or the film. It’s a real-world impact that is historic and that’s going to last generations.’
