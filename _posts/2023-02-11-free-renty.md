In celebration of Black History Month USA, this compelling documentary tells the story of Tamara Lanier, an African American woman determined to force Harvard University to cede possession of daguerreotypes of her great-great-great grandfather, an enslaved man named Renty. Following this special screening, guests will discuss the implications of this trial.

**David Grubin** is a director, writer, producer, and cinematographer who has produced over 100 films, ranging across history, art, poetry, and science, winning every award in the field of documentary television, including two Alfred I. Dupont awards, three George Foster Peabody prizes, five Writer’s Guild prizes, and ten Emmys.

His biographies for the PBS series American Experience ­– _Abraham and Mary Lincoln: A House Divided_; _LBJ_; _Truman_; _TR: The Story of Theodore Roosevelt_; and _FDR_ – have set the standard for television biography. His five-part series for PBS – _Healing and the Mind with Bill Moyers_ – has won many awards, and the companion book, for which he was executive editor, rose to number one on _The New York Times_ Best Sellers list, remaining on the list for 32 weeks. His award-winning independent feature film _Downtown Express_ has been screened at festivals in America and abroad. Grubin has received a Guggenheim Fellowship, has been a Montgomery Fellow at Dartmouth College, and is the recipient of an honorary doctorate from his alma mater, Hamilton College.

A former chairman of the board of directors of The Film Forum, he is currently a member of the Society of American Historians, and sits on the board at Poets House. Grubin has taught documentary film producing in Columbia University’s Graduate Film Program, and has lectured on filmmaking across the country.

He has recently completed _Free Renty: Lanier v. Harvard_, telling the story of Tamara Lanier, an African American woman determined to force Harvard University to cede possession of daguerreotypes of her great-great-great grandfather, an enslaved man named Renty. The daguerreotypes were commissioned in 1850 by a Harvard biologist to provide evidence in support of his poisonous theory of the superiority of the white race. The images remain emblematic of America’s failure to acknowledge the cruelty of slavery, the racist science that supported it and the white supremacy that continues to infect our society today. The film can be seen on Amazon, iTunes/Apple TV, Google Play, Microsoft Xbox, Vimeo, VUDU, YouTube, Amazon Home Video, and through your cable provider’s VOD offerings.
