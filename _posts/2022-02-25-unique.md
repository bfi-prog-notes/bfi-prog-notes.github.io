Cinematic projections, live music and immersive technology – these are the elements that form UNIQUE, world-renowned artist Tupac Martir’s newest masterpiece, based on the premise of self-reflection and identity.  Combining the heritage of the screen with the endless possibilities of immersive technology, this work aims to form a new performance tradition – namely, Performative-R – by integrating live music, dance, set design, AR, VR and projection. The conductor leads and sculpts the performances of live musicians, dancers, and real-time graphics into a cohesive piece of art, combining the vitality of live improvisation with the nuance of crafted narrative. The audience has three options to experience this immersive concert using either Virtual, Augmented Reality or Projection Mapping to accompany the live audio experience. Immersive technology and art combine to deliver a unique, bespoke performance.

**Tupac Martir** is a multimedia artist and founder of Satore Studio.
