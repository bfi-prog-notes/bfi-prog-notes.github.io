In this instant cult classic, based on a short story by Clive Barker, white graduate student Helen Lyle (Madsen) is researching urban legends when she discovers the tale of the Candyman (Todd). Born a free Black man, he was lynched for having a romantic relationship with a white woman. The Candyman has long haunted the Black residents of the Chicago housing project Cabrini-Green. But his focus shifts to Helen, who reminds him of his white lover. And then comes carnage.

**A contemporary review**

In adapting and elaborating on ‘The Forbidden’, a story from Volume Five of Clive Barker’s _Books of Blood_,  Bernard  Rose has done an even more skilful job of translating Barker’s singular approach to the screen than the author himself achieved in _Hellraiser_ and _Nightbreed_. Rose retains Barker’s outré imagery, even taking the story’s first sentence (‘the perfect geometry of the Spectator Street Estate was only visible from the air’) as a cue for a Saul Bass-style title sequence and frequent punctuating vertical overhead shots of calm cityscapes. He also strengthens the brittle characterisation and slim plot that sometimes render Barker’s stories rather remote. In shifting the story from Liverpool to Chicago, the film loses out only once – stripped of its Guy Fawkes function, the large bonfire that provides the climax is rather puzzling in the context of urban America. Otherwise much is gained in the way of background, including the based-on-fact twinning of the Cabrini Green ghetto with Helen’s condominium, a building erected as public housing but converted to yuppie use, so that Helen’s trespass begins even before she ventures out among the disenfranchised.

Cunningly establishing its ground rules with a succession of dramatised Candyman anecdotes and variations related to Helen in the course of her research, the film taps into the rich vein of urban legend that has sustained such series as the _Halloween_ and _Elm Street_ sagas, but for the first time addresses the process of mythification itself rather than simply using a nursery rhyme to ‘explain’ a monster’s origins. Candyman, a striking black figure who is at once a grimmer literal spook than Freddy Krueger and a menacing incarnation of the metaphorical ‘spook’ perceived as a threat by white America, draws his strength from the stories told about him. In dialogue lifted verbatim from the original text, he almost seductively asks Helen to join him in an anecdote: ‘Your death would be a parable to frighten children with, lovers would use it as an excuse to cling closer together.’

In adding to the plot complications of the story, Rose has given the underrated Virginia Madsen room to develop a strong performance as the superficial academic forced to confront actual suffering and horror. He intersperses the expected but perfectly-realised supernatural encounters between Helen and Tony Todd’s hollow-eyed, fur-coated, hook-handed bogeyman with unexpected Hitchcockian reversals, as when a bloodied and hysterical Helen is calmly strip-searched by an impassive matron, or in the complex betrayals and fears summoned in her post-escape confrontation with her errant husband and his terrified girlfriend. The film combines an overall predictability, as Helen is drawn into Candyman’s dark place like the protagonist of an episode from a 60’s Amicus anthology, with a scene-to-scene sense of surprise as the plot progresses in daring leaps and ellipses which powerfully convey Helen’s increasing bewilderment and fear.

As with _Paperhouse_, his debut feature, Rose enjoys marshalling the archetypal ingredients of the horror genre – knee-jerk shocks, stalking bogeyman, touches of dark humour – but also locates the horrors in an identifiable and credible landscape of urban decay (in contrast to the neo-Dickensian parody of ghetto life in Wes Craven’s _The People under the Stairs_ for example, the Cabrini Green estate is a model of sociological accuracy). Candyman’s bee-swarming, gut-splitting, family-destroying horrors have their root in a subtle malaise that is ultimately a lot scarier than the admittedly relishable monster movie business.
