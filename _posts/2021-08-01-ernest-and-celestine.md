**What’s it about?**

Bears live upstairs and mice live downstairs and never the twain shall meet. That’s just the way it is. But this delicate balance between the species is blown apart when Ernest, a large, solitary and rather grumpy bear, meets Celestine, a wide-eyed orphan mouse. Eventually he welcomes her into his home, but the authorities have other ideas... This exceptional film brings life to Gabrielle Vincent’s enchanting characters and her beautifully drawn animal world.
