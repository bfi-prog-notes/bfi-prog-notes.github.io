**‘If Everyone Likes You, You’re Not Doing It Right’:  The Career of Bette Davis**  
Bette Davis was born Ruth Elizabeth Davis in 1908 in Lowell, Massachusetts, and had the nickname ‘Betty’ from early childhood. In 1926, aged 18, she saw a production of Ibsen’s _The Wild Duck_ and was inspired to go into the theatre. Her move into the movies came in 1930, when she moved to Hollywood and screen-tested for Universal. But her time there was not a success, and she was about to return to New York when actor George Arliss chose her to appear in the Warner Bros film _The Man Who Played God_ (1932). The film proved to be the break she was after, and Warners offered her a five-year contract.

Davis’s critical breakthrough came with _Of Human Bondage_ (1934), and she won her first Academy Award the following year for her part in _Dangerous_ (1935). But Davis felt that her career was being damaged by the mediocre roles she was being given, and she took Warners to court in a bid to break her contract. She was unsuccessful, but the next period of her career saw her fortunes change dramatically, with films such as William Wyler’s _Jezebel_ (1938), for which she won her second Oscar; _Dark Victory_ (1939); _Juarez_ (1939);  _The_ _Letter_ (1940); _The Little Foxes_ (1941); and _Now, Voyager_ (1942).

The immediate post-war years saw Davis’s popularity with audiences decline slightly, despite films such as _A Stolen Life_ (1946) and _Winter Meeting_ (1948), but 1950’s _All About Eve_ proved to be a career high. Her career struggled through the 1950s, but saw a remarkable revival with 1962’s _What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?_, in which she starred opposite her old rival Joan Crawford. The 1970s saw her appear in films such as _Burnt_ _Offerings_ (1976), and in 1977 she became the first woman to be awarded a lifetime achievement award by the American Film Institute. Despite ill health, she worked intermittently through the 1980s, up to her death in 1989, upon which tributes were paid to her as one of the finest actors – and most distinctive stars – in Hollywood history.
