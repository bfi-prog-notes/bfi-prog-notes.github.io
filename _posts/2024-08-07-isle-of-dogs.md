Many auteur directors create films that seem to exist in pocket universes as self-contained, circumscribed and minutely thought-through as the virtual-reality environment of a computer game or the fantasy setting of a paperback trilogy. Wes Anderson’s early films _Bottle Rocket_ (1996) and _Rushmore_ (1998) took place in more or less the real world, but concerned fantasists who tried to make their imaginings concrete (or at least papier-mâché) reality. Since then, he has voyaged deeper into the universes created for each of his films and found avatars in visionaries and explorers like Max Fischer (Jason Schwartzman), the schoolboy theatrical impresario of _Rushmore_, and Steve Zissou (Bill Murray), the Jacques Cousteau figure in _The Life Aquatic with Steve Zissou_. _Moonrise Kingdom_ (2012) was set on an imaginary island and came – like every fantasy trilogy since Tolkien – with an invented map. _The Grand Budapest Hotel_ (2014), a Russian doll of shaggy-dog stories, embedded human eccentrics in an imaginary institution (and country) visited over decades. Anderson’s secondary worlds aren’t permanent idylls but places in the throes of sometimes cataclysmic change. With _Fantastic Mr Fox_ (2009), Anderson’s earlier venture into stop-motion animation (and his only film based on a pre-existing source), the director was at last able to control all the variables – in this mode, every single throwaway prop has to be made from scratch.

_Isle of Dogs_ – set in a near-future Japan, where the mayor of Megasaki has ordered that all the city’s dogs be exiled to an offshore refuse dump – shows the influence of everyone in the field from Jan Svankmajer to Nick Park, and makes extensive use of a quirk discovered by Willis H. O’Brien on _King Kong_ (1933) – that the animators’ fingers cause furry puppets to ripple in a manner approximating a constant light breeze. Even more than most of Anderson’s films, _Isle of Dogs_ will attract repeat viewings because it is so densely packed with sly visual gags and quietly hilarious minor characters (such as Tilda Swinton’s Oracle Dog, whose mystic reputation is down to quoting TV news headlines as if they were prophecies) that a single watch won’t pick up half the prizes. Many one-off images are startlingly beautiful, yet oddly melancholy, often finding fascinating things to see in literal detritus – the aftermath of a plane crash on a sea of waste paper, with the wreck at the centre of a burned circle… or the clouds of dust kicked up whenever animals or humans need to have an old-fashioned cartoon-style mêlée.

Like Guy Maddin (_The Forbidden Room_) and Anna Biller (_The Love Witch_), Anderson often looks to an eclectic variety of film sources, making collages out of unlikely bits and pieces of popular and high culture. Here, the dominant influence is Japanese cinema, with explicit nods to Kurosawa (music stings and _bushido_ cool from _Seven Samurai_ and echoes of the rubbish-dump community of _Dodes’ka-den_) and the science-fiction films of Honda Ishiro (with the space-suited boy pilot and steel-frilled mecha-dogs). But in having dogs as most of the main (and anglophone) characters, Anderson can’t avoid evoking _Lady and the Tramp_ (1955) and _One Hundred and One Dalmatians_ (1960), albeit with the analogues of show dog Lady and street dog Tramp – voiced by Scarlett Johansson and Bryan Cranston – conducting themselves like the mysterious, slightly fey outlaws of Seijun Suzuki’s films. A supporting pack of wry, chatty cast-off dogs (voiced by Anderson regulars Murray, Ed Norton, Bob Balaban and Jeff Goldblum) come across as canine versions of the crews of mostly merry misfits of _The Royal Tenenbaums_ (2001) and _The Life Aquatic_.

Like many Anderson films, _Isle of Dogs_ has a non-linear story, an omniscient narrator (Courtney B. Vance), onscreen chapter headings and an array of distancing devices – all the Japanese characters speak mostly in unsubtitled Japanese, but translators and translation devices pop up to keep the audience up to date – which theoretically draw attention to the packaging rather than the contents. However, this is such a labour of love, drawing so much from its creator’s enthusiasm for all manner of things – not least, of course, dogs – that it avoids disappearing inside its magnificent artifice. A speech that Cranston’s stray Chief gives about literally biting the hand that fed him when he muffed a chance at a good home is among the most perfectly written, staged and played scenes in recent cinema – it would be a surefire Oscar clip if awards had categories that could encompass achievements in this byway of cinema, where great acting is as much down to the hands of animators as the dialogue delivery. The trick of absurdist comedy is often to know when to take an element (here emotional, but elsewhere in the film political) so seriously that it hits home without even abandoning a fundamental ridiculousness – which turns out to be a profound reaction to the state of the real world.  
**Kim Newman, _Sight and Sound_, April 2018**  

With its semi-fictional Japanese setting, its construction out of comic book-like chapters and its intercut themes of nature, heroism, technology, rescue and honour, perhaps it was only natural that the film would also reverberate with echoes of Japanese pop culture and some of Japan’s greatest film directors, from Yasujiro Ozu to Kurosawa to Seijun Suzuki, as well as the Japanese monster films of the 50s and 60s, with their climactic disasters. ‘We think of it as referring to a whole range of Japanese filmmakers and Japanese culture, but Kurosawa is the main movie influence,’ says Wes Anderson.

It’s hard to even quantify Kurosawa’s impact on cinema because he arced so gracefully through a huge pendulum of genres from noir, to Samurai, to Shakespeare, to melodrama. But for _Isle of Dogs_, Anderson was mostly focused on Kurosawa’s contemporary (for their time), city-based movies: _Drunken Angel_, _Stray Dog_, _High and Low_ and _The Bad Sleep Well_. Each of these kinetically charged films unfolds in gritty domains of crime and corruption. Each seems to transcend the dark side of the modern world with characters of the utmost honesty and humanity. And seen in each is the legendary Toshiro Mifune, whose expressive countenance inspires the look of Mayor Kobayashi.

Another branch of inspiration came from two 19th century, Edo-period woodblock print masters: Hiroshige and Hokusai, whose emphasis on colour and line deeply influenced European Impressionists. Their _ukyio-e_ (translates to ‘pictures of the floating world’) artworks capture fleeting moments of pleasure focusing on natural landscapes, far-flung travels, flora and fauna, geishas and kabuki actors. In preparation for the film, Anderson collected a wide swath of woodblock print images and the storyboard artists trawled through the extensive collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London. Then, by osmosis, the folkloric Japanese style began to merge with the tactile, handmade feel of stop-motion.

Recalls animatic editor Edward Bursch: ‘The first thing I received on this film, on 12 April 2015, was the script from Wes, along with several reference images and a video. The reference images were just a few Japanese woodblock prints, a picture of a dog and a picture of a dog statue in Japan. The video was of three taiko drummers drumming this ferocious beat, and that set the mood.’

For all the Japanese (and other) influences one might joyfully trace in the film, the world it conjures is decidedly like no other. Says the film’s titles designer Erica Dorn, who grew up in Japan, of how it all comes together: ‘The world of _Isle of Dogs_ is kind of an alternative reality. It looks and feels like Japan, but it’s a slightly dreamier version, a slightly more Wes Anderson version. That is the beauty of setting the film in a made-up city, in a made-up time: you get a certain amount of artistic license. The blending of old and new is very common in Japan. There are scenes in the film that are very minimalist and _wabi-sabi_; but then you switch over to the city, which is maximalist and very intense. So, there’s that feeling of Japan but it’s all filtered through Wes’s own way of seeing.’
