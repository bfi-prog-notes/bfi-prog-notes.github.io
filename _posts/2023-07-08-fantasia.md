_Fantasia_ opens with Deems Taylor, better known to 1940 audiences as a radio broadcaster than a composer, walking on stage amid a tuning-up orchestra. As _Fantasia_’s host, he explains that this animated feature won’t tell a single story; rather, it will be a series of classical music pieces set to animation. (_Fantasia_’s working title was  
_The Concert Feature_.) What we’ll see, Taylor says, ‘are the designs and pictures and stories that music inspired in the minds and imaginations of a group of artists. In other words, they are not going to be the interpretations of trained musicians… which I think is all to the good.’

The film, however, is blatantly seeking musical legitimacy. Its conductor is Leopold Stokowski, a tawny-haired maestro star and proven screen property who’d appeared in the 1937 musical comedy _One Hundred Men and a Girl_, featuring Deanna Durbin. We mostly just see the great man’s illumined back as he leads us into _Fantasia_’s animation. The first sequence is a semi-abstract piece, set to Stokowski’s symphonic rendering of Bach’s ‘Toccata and Fugue’. The on-screen ripples and contrails are linear simplifications of the work of Oskar Fischinger, a German avant-garde animator.

Then come dances from Tchaikovsky’s ‘Nutcracker Suite’: flower fairies, sultry goldfish and Art Babbitt’s famous nodding mushrooms (on-screen for barely a minute). After that, with apologies to Stokowski, comes _Fantasia_’s true icon: Mickey Mouse as Dukas’ ‘Sorcerer’s Apprentice’, overwhelmed by his army of water-bearing broomsticks. Stravinsky’s ‘Rite of Spring’ takes place on an early Earth of volcanoes, evolution and dinosaurs. Then there’s a cherub-strewn version of Beethoven’s ‘Pastoral Symphony’, more on which below; and a burlesque of Ponchielli’s ‘Dance of the Hours’, with ballerina ostriches, hippos, elephants and alligators. Damned souls caper in hellfire for a colossal Devil, to the screaming strings of Mussorgsky’s ‘Night on Bald Mountain’. Dawn segues into a secularised ‘Ave Maria’ (Schubert) where the Madonna – after much indecision on Walt’s part – doesn’t show.

_Fantasia_’s critical reputation is mostly the centaurettes’ fault, those half-horse, half-female fancies, disporting themselves round Mount Olympus in the Pastoral segment. In 1995, Britain’s Channel 4 screened a muckraking documentary called _Secret Lives: Walt Disney_. With admirable precision, it homed in on the centaurettes. ‘(_Fantasia_’s) banal, often tacky imagery came as a disappointment to many,’ explained the narration. ‘The heads of Disneyfied American teenagers are grafted onto the bodies of centaurs… On seeing this, (Walt) Disney was impressed. He said, “Gee, this’ll make Beethoven.”’

Actually, the Beethoven comment came from a story meeting prior to the animation, and no ‘Gee’ was transcribed. (Neal Gabler quotes the line in his Disney biography.) But such smears were part of a fight Walt had picked himself, setting the ordinary American (that is, himself) against the stuffed shirts of the music establishment.

  
‘We figured that if ordinary folk like ourselves could find entertainment in the visualisations of so-called classical music, so would the average audience…’ Walt said after _Fantasia_’s release. ‘I imagine that the 1200 young people in my organisation who helped make _Fantasia_ are a pretty fair cross-section of average American culture. They’re from the average American home with the average American advantages and upbringing. Every day I see them prove they know the difference between the real stuff and the phoney.’

The populism both provoked and pre-empted a blunt response from Igor Stravinsky, the only living composer represented in _Fantasia_. He declared, ‘The mass add nothing to art.’ Well, _Fantasia_ may not be art, though the label fits it surely closer than ‘kitsch,’ which reviewers wave at the film like a talisman. For what is clear is that, within the hand-drawn form, _Fantasia_’s scope and spectacle are matchless.

In ‘Rite of Spring’, for example, we wander through space to a molten Earth where volcanoes blast like ships’ funnels. From macrocosm to underbrush: the ‘Nutcracker’ is a waterborne ballroom of whirling blossoms, cascades of dancing thistle-men. Gibbous legions swarm round Bald Mountain; one reviewer described them as mad sperm. Dance of the Hours’ bestial ballet ends in zigzag insanity, with the ’gators riding ostriches and twirling hippos on their scales.

Walt publicly thanked Stokowski and Taylor for ‘holding my head up when the water got too deep.’ But doesn’t Mickey command water with the stolen Sorcerer’s hat? No, he only dreams he does, when it threatens to drown him (later, it drowns the whole Earth). After his omnipotent master saves the day, everyman Mickey gives his cheesiest grin in the film’s most Disney moment. But the Sorcerer cocks his brow like Walt. Is Walt him, Mickey, or both? The question exercised critics, who noted that _Fantasia_ was made when Walt was at the height of his hubris, and rushing into calamity.

The scowling Sorcerer, who conjures great butterflies into being and parts the waters like Moses, is a power-sibling to Stokowski on his podium, Zeus throwing down his thunderbolts and even Chernabog, the devil of Bald Mountain, toying with the damned in his giant hands. But there are gentler magicians, more in line with the Disney we know, like the Nutcracker flower-fairy who yawns, lounges and lights up a spiderweb. Then there are the heroes without magic: the perky little mushroom, captivatingly out of step with his peers; the bold foal-Pegasus, chasing a rainbow to its underwater roots; and the animal ballerinas who spoof a spoof through the sheer beauty of their dance-steps. Chuck Jones mocked _Fantasia_’s hubris in his Wagnerian cartoon _What’s Opera Doc?_, but ‘Dance of the Hours’ had beaten him at his parodic game.
