_+ pre-recorded Q&A_

Celebrate the diversity and fluidity of desire with Touched, an alternative Valentineâ€™s Day screening showcasing sensuous shorts by female and non-binary filmmakers. Co-curated by collectives T A P E and Invisible Women, this subversive and surprising programme connects filmmakers from across the decades by combining contemporary work with rarities from the archive.  
The result is a witty, intimate and unapologetically sexy selection of films that open up space for wider discussions about self-love, intimacy and longing.
