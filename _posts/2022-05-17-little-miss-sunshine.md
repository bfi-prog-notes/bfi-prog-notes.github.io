‘This is one of the first films I remember watching... It’s full of heart, deliriously funny, and the cast is superb’.<br>
**Claire Cho, BFI member**<br>

When the Hoover family discover that young Olive (Abigail Breslin) has qualified for the Little Miss Sunshine beauty pageant they all jump in their yellow van and begin an 800-mile road trip from New Mexico to California, with only two days to get there. Screenwriter Michael Arndt’s sparkling debut features rounded characters and a delicately balanced tragi-comic edge.<br>

A dark, ironic tone is struck at the outset of _Little Miss Sunshine_, as footage of a chronically depressed man in hospital plays over the title. It transpires that protagonist Frank is a failed suicide, a fact that establishes early on the themes of success and failure that run throughout the movie. As Frank reluctantly embarks on a road trip from Albuquerque to the Little Miss Sunshine pageant in California with his sister’s family, seven-year-old competitor Olive dreams of winning the beauty parade, while her father, Richard, is obsessed with his ‘nine steps to success’ motivational programme. Richard’s son, Dwayne, meanwhile, is so fixated with getting into flight school, he’s refusing to speak until he’s accepted. Equally ambitious, Frank tried to pay the ultimate price for failing to woo a young male student and win the title of No. 1 Proust scholar (both, crushingly, went to his competitor). Over the course of the road trip, each member of the family has something to learn about accepting human failings and adjusting their goals.

But such messages are delivered relatively subtly, playing second fiddle to the film’s driving force: black comedy. While stressed mother Sheryl and sweet-natured Olive generally play the foils, their male relatives are strong comic figures. Subversive Grandpa is a heroin-snorting rebel who’s been thrown out of his retirement village and advises Dwayne to sleep with as many women as possible. Dwayne’s vow of silence takes the stock type of the sullen, silent teenager to a ridiculous extreme. He offers up choice words to his uncle via a notepad: ‘I hate everyone,’ he responds when asked who he hangs out with, angrily underlining the word ‘everyone’ when Frank queries this. Manically positive, Richard is in comic juxtaposition to his father and son, as well as his mournful, intellectual brother-in-law, who infuriates him by flooring his arguments in a single sentence. The perfect casting makes for some exceptionally confident comedy.

The most pertinent and challenging comic theme is that of society’s attitude to sexuality. Unlike Grandpa, most of the small-town American characters encountered see sex as shameful but exciting. At the Little Miss Sunshine pageant, the pre-pubescent girls are caked in make-up and pose provocatively on stage, leading Richard to furrow his brow in concern and comical disbelief (an expression that immediately renders him more sympathetic). A striptease performed by Olive is both more innocent and more openly sexual (we’re to presume it derives from her coach Grandpa’s experiences with strippers). It’s arguably less sinister than the knowing, teasing preening of her competitors, yet it’s still the focus of collective moral outrage. As the family join Olive on stage for a hilarious, uplifting finale, the film embraces Olive’s naivety in all its messy, misguided glory, exposing beauty pageants for their implicitly dangerous hypocrisy.

The subversive, anti-glamour stance is supported by the grainy look and wobbly shots of the cinematography, which mimics the appearance of documentary footage – perhaps no great surprise from a directing team known for their music documentaries. _Little Miss Sunshine_ is unmistakably an indie comedy, but with its accessible humour and universal themes, it’s one that surpasses many of its Hollywood contemporaries and deserves to be a cult hit.<br>
