Based on a popular 1946 novel, _Trottie True_ can be related to the Victorian music-hall world of _Champagne Charlie_ (d. Alberto Cavalcanti, 1944) and _Gaiety George_ (d. George King, 1946), set against the background of the Gaiety ‘musical comedy’ shows.

From the opening credits (over a red heart emblem) the central question is evident: who will win the heart of Trottie? The candidates are obsessed balloonist Sid Skinner; serious-minded aristocrat Lord Digby Landon; ‘bounder’ Maurice Breckenham; backer of Gaiety Shows Arthur Briggs and fellow artiste Joe Jugg, but morose Digby and dull balloonist Sid are the main contenders. Whereas Trottie is a spirited gal, vivacious and lively, these men are a rather dull bunch, lacking in any genuine gaiety or charm, so Jean Kent is able to shine with her central star performance; not surprisingly, this was her favourite film role.

The early vitality of the Bedford music-hall scene is not maintained, and a major omission is the lack of a fully staged Gaiety number, especially as in 1948 there were still survivors around familiar with the original stagings. But Rank were wary of funding lavish musicals following the ‘disaster’ of _London Town_  (d. Wesley Ruggles, 1946) and Jean Kent even had a struggle to keep her songs in the film. The music score, by Benjamin Frankel, is full of old world charm with a delightful opening ‘trot’ theme and waltzes such as the wistful ‘Dreaming’, composed in 1911 by English ‘waltz king’ Archibald Joyce, so evocative of the Edwardian era.

There is much to enjoy in _Trottie True_, but these are mainly surface pleasures. Both art direction and colour are first class, with much eye candy in colour and form, art direction, and detail in costumes and millinery. Harry Waxman’s cinematography nicely differentiates the emotional temperatures of the True family home, with its warm, dark colours, and the Wellwater stately pile, in cold, light blues. Visual treats include an early close-up of a bird in a gilded cage (bride as trophy?), Gaiety Girls travelling to a picnic in their white dresses and finery, Bouncie’s dressing room bedecked with flowers, and a lavish servant’s ball. British 1940s Technicolor films offer an abundance of visual pleasures, especially when lovingly restored by the BFI National Archive. _Trottie True_ is not among the best known, but comes beautifully packaged, gift wrapped with all the trimmings.

**Jean Kent (1921-2013)**

In Anthony Asquith’s 1950 film _The Woman in Question_, a murdered woman is presented via several flashbacks through the eyes of different characters who knew her. From slovenly to prim and proper, these diverse interpretations of the victim are played with considerable skill by the star of the film, Jean Kent.

Born Joan Mildred Field in Brixton, South London in June 1921, Kent’s parents were music hall artistes and she became a dancer and chorus girl at a young age. Her film career began in 1935 but really took off when she was signed to Gainsborough and appeared in a string of their costume melodramas, including _Fanny by Gaslight_ (1944), _Madonna of the Seven Moons_ (1945)  and _Caravan_ (1946).

It was this last title which the BFI screened in 2011 in celebration of Kent’s 90th birthday, when she appeared before a large and appreciative audience who joined in an enthusiastic rendition of ‘Happy Birthday’. I was fortunate enough to act as her host on that occasion and found her charming and unpretentious; clearly overwhelmed by the wonderful reception the public gave her, she sent us a warm letter of thanks.

She was delighted that we chose _Caravan_ to celebrate her career – she had very happy memories of that film as it was during the shoot that she met her future husband, Jusuf Ramart, who had a small role. They were wed four months later, with Stewart Granger as best man, and their marriage lasted until Ramart’s death in 1989.

_Caravan_ is perhaps Gainsborough’s most camp and over the top excursion into melodrama but Jean Kent wasn’t fazed by the audience’s laughter at some of its excesses. She had no illusions about the artistic merit of the films, but communicated the fun she had making them and the escape and exoticism they brought to people during the post-war years of privation.

In _Caravan_ she plays a Spanish gypsy who nurses an amnesiac Stewart Granger, falling in love with him along the way. While her accent doesn’t quite ring true, she looks stunning in her lavish costumes and the provocative dance she performs is about as sexually charged as British cinema was permitted to be at the time.

Post-Gainsborough, she proved herself a versatile actor, playing a juvenile delinquent in _Good-time Girl_ (1947), a music hall star in _Trottie True_ (1949), and the cruel, unfaithful wife in _The Browning Version_ (1951).

As the 1950s drew to a close, her film roles began to dry up and despite some television work and a small part in _Shout at the Devil_ (1976), her acting career came to a premature end. Although she was keen to continue working, she was unfairly overlooked. While her Gainsborough co-stars Margaret Lockwood and Phyllis Calvert were both given their own TV series’ (_Justice_, 1971-74, and _Kate_, 1970-72, respectively) Kent was offered no such small-screen comeback. But she showed no trace of bitterness and lived out her life in the Suffolk countryside, welcoming fans and researchers into her home with grace and hospitality.

She was perhaps the most naturally beautiful of the female stars which Gainsborough transformed into huge box-office draws in the 1940s. Her smile could be winning, provocative or downright menacing, while her voice had just a touch of huskiness. Her passing breaks one more link in the chain connecting us with the golden age of British cinema.
