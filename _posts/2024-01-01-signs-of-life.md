Herzog’s highly atmospheric first feature centres on three German soldiers posted, towards the end of WW2, far from military action at a munitions base on the Greek island of Kos. Eventually inertia, boredom and frustration take their toll… The writer-director’s sense of the powerful influence of landscape and his ability to vividly evoke the strangeness of the world are already impressive.

**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

In protracted long shot, _Lebenszeichen_ opens with an army truck meandering like a befuddled insect (flies and cockroaches are soon repeating the motions) over scrubby Mediterranean countryside, bearing the wounded Stroszek away to his convalescent duties. And rather like an entomologist who looks up from the microscope to take in the scene through a telescope, Herzog turns the perspective inside out in the film's final shot: a subjective view from the back of a truck, with the landscape receding through billowing clouds of dust as the hero, now absorbed by his madness, is removed for good and a narrator delivers his epitaph, ‘... they could do nothing to him, for he had found  his calling.’

The reversal is a chart to the progress Stroszek makes through his ‘illness’ – from an arbitrary and solitary speck of life to a crusader who takes on ‘the cause of man’ and commits self-immolation attempting to uncover what may lie beneath all the arbitrary signs of life. It is also a key to the method by which Herzog jolts images free of the narrative and leaves actions as detached and stranded by the irrational as the wreckage in the desert in _Fata Morgana_. Where later films have located the history of man in a terrain and on a time scale all their own (the terminal ward of _Even Dwarfs Started Small_, the desert myths of _Fata Morgana_), _Lebenszeichen_, Herzog’s first feature, extracts a similar meditation from a specific historical situation and a not unfamiliar  plot format.

Wounded in Crete during the Second World War, good soldier Stroszek is removed from the fighting and left to heal in the sultry, dulling climate of a non-combat zone. In the ‘time out of war’ situation, his physical wound becomes an opening on the frightening illogic of his situation, the absurdity of not just the war but of all the artefacts of human existence which stand petrified around him. Herzog gives peculiar weight to the initial ‘accident’ of the wounding of Stroszek: ‘It occurred during a lull in the fighting, in a village held by the Germans,’ the narrator comments, and a long, swooping camera track through deserted, sun-baked streets makes an abrupt turn and comes upon two uniformed bodies, flicking away instantly to stare idly down another empty street, before returning briefly to the evidence of this glancing intrusion  of death.

Having been brought so close, and so inappropriately, to extinction, Stroszek’s convalescence is clouded by a growing, oppressive sense that existence itself may be no more than an absurd accident; the signs of life are drenched with associations – all the family possessions which Stroszek finds so touching in the house where he and Nora have been billeted; the pieces of ancient statuary used by later generations to patch up the walls of the fortress – but like the inscriptions over which Becker patiently toils, they are now devoid of meaning.

In the brief histories it gives of the three guardians of a useless treasure, _Lebenszeichen_ provides a catalogue of casual dislocations: all three are peculiarly unsuited to their present profession, and to most of the activities they have engaged in all their lives (Meinhard has turned from being a bar-keeper to a crane operator with no particular motive; the ailing Becker was passed fit for service while stronger men were refused; and Stroszek, as the narrator relates, ‘had tried several jobs without success’). Desperately trying to disguise the erosion of all sense of purpose, Stroszek volunteers to take the night duty, so that he can stand before the lights of the village, ‘in order to show the world that he is functional’. Eventually collapsing in terror in the face of the tiny circlings of existence (the routine of the pointless duty; the colony of flies that are bottled within the gypsy’s tiny wooden owl in order to produce its minute, puzzling movements; the forest of windmills that finally provoke a breakdown), Stroszek struggles to launch a grandly romantic rebellion, which Herzog films lyrically as if it were the last gasp of an individual no longer able to live as a man and unable to become a god.

In a lushly mesmerising atmosphere of suffocating heat and chattering insects, where all history might be drying up at the roots, Herzog’s first film is a limpidly clear meditation on life shrivelling under a self-imposed oppression; and in its championing of a failed rebellion, an anticipation of the darker scenes of _Aguirre, Wrath of God_.
