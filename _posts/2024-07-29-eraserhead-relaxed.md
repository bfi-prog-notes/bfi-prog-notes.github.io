**Content warning:** Contains strong gore and disturbing surreal imagery.

David Lynch’s debut feature takes us into the heart of a bleak industrial wasteland, exploring the grotesque underbelly of modern life and the nuclear family through body horror and surrealism. The film expertly crafts a sense of unease that is enhanced by Lynch and Alan Splet’s chilling sound design. Join us after the screening to reflect upon the film through a neurodivergent lens.

The post screening discussion will be led by filmmaker Georgia Kumari Bradburn of the Neurocultures Collective and the Autism Through Cinema Podcast.<br><br>
