**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

_The Uninvited_ was, famously, Hollywood’s first authentic ghost story. It’s a slick, romantic, sometimes even campy potboiler that, in its most crystalline genre moments, still delivers an irresistible darkness-at-the-bottom-of-the-stairs frisson. However glib the film gets, the sound of sobbing in the darkness runs up the back of your neck on little clawed feet.

Ray Milland and Ruth Hussey star as an oddly coupled brother and sister who decide to buy a haunted Cornwall-cliffside mansion. The resident moaners and weepers therein compel them to get involved with local secrets, namely Gail Russell, a haunted village lass standing astride a backstory of possession and murder.

Because it’s the first, and because it was still wartime, Lewis Allen’s film can’t hope to chin up against movies from more than 15 years later, such as  _The Innocents_ (1961) or _The Haunting_ (1963). But it’s an expert launch of pulp all the same, burned into the psyche of moviegoers of the day, and fuelled by Milland’s particular brand of secretive cynicism and by Russell, whose fragile, haunted demeanour serves the context in unforgettable ways. To learn about her subsequent alcoholism and jittery ruin is to feel a real Hollywood ghost story in your bones.

One of Hollywood’s first attempts at a serious ghost story, this relatively lavish Paramount production (based on _Uneasy Freehold_, a novel by the Irish writer Dorothy Macardle) was plainly influenced by Val Lewton’s cycle of low-budget chillers. Gauntly glamorous Elizabeth Russell, a Lewton regular best remembered as the other cat woman in 1942’s _Cat People_, is recognisable as the model for a portrait that plays a significant part in the story here. (Like _Rebecca_ and _Laura_, this makes a fetish of a picture that stands in for the not-quite-absent woman who haunts the film.) In a peculiar, extra-narrative instance of ominous doubling, the young woman most in peril from the malign ghost is played by the frail, unearthly Gail Russell, whose real name was also Elizabeth Russell.

The general classiness of the film runs to sophisticated dialogue rattled off by Ray Milland and Ruth Hussey as urbanite siblings who buy a clifftop house in Cornwall; a memorably romantic/shivery Victor Young score which spun off the popular song ‘Stella by Starlight’; and a tactful approach to the story’s paranormal activity that depends as much on performance as camera tricks. Some quite transgressive material was somehow sneaked past the Hays Office, including a seething Cornelia Otis Skinner as the ghost’s maniacal lesbian admirer (another Lewton theme) and a happy ending which hinges on the revelation that the heroine is the daughter of her father’s sensual mistress, not his frigid wife. It was Lewis Allen’s first film, and he never did anything quite as striking again.

**A contemporary review**  
Based on the novel, adapted for the screen by Dodie Smith and Frank Partos, this is a very good job technically. Some beautiful coastal scenery and an attempt to reconstruct a Devon village give variety to the gloomy concentration on the haunted house. The production department has created beautiful interiors too. And the photography, including the ghostly emanations, is extremely efficient. The casting and acting – Donald Crisp and Cornelia Otis Skinner are in the supporting roles – are also good. It remains a question, however, whether such a film should ever be made, producing visual evidence of unexplained occult phenomena which, to say the least, have never yet been photographed.
