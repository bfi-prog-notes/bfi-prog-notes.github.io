The Indian jungle is the setting for this wonderful adaptation of Rudyard Kipling’s tale of an abandoned orphan named Mowgli who is raised by wolves. During the course of his adventure-packed young life, Mowgli befriends a bear (Baloo) and panther (Bagheera), encounters an unpredictable orang-utan king, narrowly escapes a hypnotising snake and is pursued by Shere Khan, a malevolent tiger. It was the last film that Walt Disney worked on and remains a fitting tribute to him. It is also deserving of its place among the list of the most popular animated films of all time.

‘That looks good… hopping up and down now… wiggling his fanny…’ In charming archive footage, _The Jungle Book_ animators Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston pore through a sequence of Thomas’ drawings, featuring the bear character Baloo. As Thomas lets his drawings fall, flipbook fashion, his friend mimics the bear’s swinging; a balding fiftysomething man in short-sleeved shirt and glasses, who’s so spontaneously caught up in the motion that he’s moved to dance.

_The Jungle Book_ was the last cartoon feature supervised by Walt Disney, who died ten months before its release in October 1967. Some commentators see Walt’s input as perfunctory, though the 2007 DVD presses the case that he drove the film. A hit on its first release, _The Jungle Book_ remains one of the most fondly regarded Disneys among non-cartoon fans. One need only hum a few notes from the breezy ‘Bare Necessities’ (sung by Phil Harris’ Baloo, who dominates the film), to draw smiles from any crowd.

More serious-minded commentators, though, often take the part of the disapproving panther Bagheera. Leonard Maltin called _The Jungle Book_ ‘one of the most forgettable’ of Disney’s films. Michael Barrier deemed it one of the worst. Even John Grant, who defends the film, complains that its story ‘meanders a little aimlessly; one keeps waiting for something really boggling to happen, but it never quite does.’

As with other Disney’s adaptations, one can mourn the lost opportunities in the source material. For example, Rudyard Kipling’s book features a lyrical, dazzling description of the jungle boy Mowgli being captured by monkeys and swung with them through the treetops. In the film, this is reduced to a few throwaway shots while the artists serve up slapstick for Baloo and the monkeys, exposing the mechanics of the Disney formula even more nakedly than the recycled animation. When the characters snatch Mowgli from each other after ‘I Wanna Be like You,’ their manic motions are taken from Rat, Mole and the weasels in a 1949 Disney feature, _The Adventures of Ichabod and  Mr. Toad_.

Yet _The Jungle Book_ has wit with its rough and tumble. The military elephant Colonel Hathi inspects one of his troops and tuts, ‘A dusty muzzle… Soldier, remember in battle a trunk can save your life.’ His comically grave pachyderm face, drawn by John Lounsbery, is a mass of pompous lines, a stylistic holdover from _One Hundred and One Dalmatians_. The girlish sibilants of Sterling Holloway, voicing Kaa, are matched in the snake’s curling and coiling. Louis Prima’s performance is punctuated by the oversized arms of ape king Louie, giving his trumpeting mass and meat. The villainous Shere Khan (drawn by Milt Kahl) has only to turn away from the camera, letting George Sanders’ silky tones complement his rippling stripes. ‘And now for my rendezvous with the little lost man-cub…’

The man-cub himself shows little sign of his feral upbringing, being malleable or pigheaded as the story demands. Yet there’s a pathos to the repeated scenes of him wandering dissolute through the jungle, oblivious to its beauty, amid the melancholia of George Bruns’ music, Walter Sheet’s orchestration and the jungle backdrops styled by Al Dempster, which tend to _Bambi_’s watercolour impressionism. It’s these elements, between and behind the fun, that give the film its form.

Even young viewers see how dull Mowgli is, which in turn highlights the grown-up, parental, perspective of Bagheera. The panther frames the film in his opening voiceover, and later argues Baloo (who wants to adopt Mowgli) into giving up the boy in an unshowy and sensitive scene. Baloo and Bagheera foreshadow the odd-couple duos in Pixar films; their parental responsibilities especially anticipate _Monsters, Inc._

Of course, kids will lose interest in Mowgli, as soon as he’s ‘twitterpated’ (to use _Bambi_’s phrase for seduction) by a village girl and heads into manhood – a fact that Kipling appreciated in his stories, dismissing Mowgli’s married life as a story for grown-ups. Johnston’s animation of the scene suggests romance, even sexuality, but Mowgli’s final expression is a goofy grin, deflating the moment even before Baloo’s deadpan, ‘He’s hooked!’ No matter; we turn and head back into the jungle with Baloo and Bagheera, back to the dancing  and singing.

**A contemporary review**  
Kipling enthusiasts may recoil in horror, and those constitutionally allergic to the Disney cartoon remain unpersuaded, but this animated feature (the last under Disney’s personal supervision) is in its way surprisingly engaging. Certainly it is far and away the best of its kind to emerge for some time. The standard of design remains the same as before, but the film scores with an inventive and often witty script and some highly entertaining vocal characterisations. George Sanders in particular is very funny as a suavely menacing Shere Khan. This is Disney at his most imaginative, with even the sentimentality kept well in check.
