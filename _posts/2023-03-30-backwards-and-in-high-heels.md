Join us for this season introduction event, celebrating the wit, the sass and, of course, the dance routines of the great Ginger Rogers. In this panel discussion, speakers Lucy Bolton, Pamela Hutchinson and David Benedict will explore the wide range of roles Rogers played, covering comedies, musicals and dramas, while delving into her unique star persona and iconic legacy.
