**His Lordship Entertains**<br>
A change of channels for the crusty old peer Lord Rustless, who had earlier been seen in two series of _Hark at Barker_ on ITV. The remainder of the cast, and the setting, Chrome Hall, also made the switch.

In this show, Chrome Hall had been opened as a hotel, but various obstacles had to be overcome to make it a success. The ITV episodes had seen Barker cast in a bewildering number of additional roles; here he was just plain Rustless. He did write the seven episodes, however, hiding beneath the pseudonym Jonathan Cobbald.<br>
**Mark Lewsiohn, _RadioTimes Guide to TV Comedy_, 1998**

Though the whole series was thought lost, the first episode resurfaced as a b/w telerecording over a decade ago. However this episode has now undergone a revolutionary colour recovery process and will be presented here in a colour version for the first time since the original broadcast.

**The London Palladium Show**  
With Jack Parnell and his Orchestra, The Palladium Dancers, The Mike Sammes Singers, Fess Parker, Rudolf Nureyev and Svetlana Benosora, Dickie Henderson, The Seekers and Dave Allen.

This is the US broadcast version of _The London Palladium Show_ which was the second series of the Palladium revival show (which for its first season had been called _The New London Palladium Show_). This edition was located at the New York Public Library.<br>
