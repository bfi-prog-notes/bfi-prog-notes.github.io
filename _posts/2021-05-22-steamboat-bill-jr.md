_Steamboat Bill, Jr._, like _The Cameraman_, displays a mastery of _mise-en-cadre_ which no other comedies have equalled. The difficulty lies in choosing only a few illustrations from a film in which every important shot so persuades our eyes of its seemingly effortless aptness. There are, as always, the spectacular moments: think of Buster, poised like a statue, apparently pondering something else amid all the silence, as the building lands on all sides of him; think of Buster, his feet clawing the earth to which the rest of him is virtually parallel, leaning into a cyclone. As always at such moments, Keaton knows that what the actor is up to is so extraordinary that the camera must record it from a proper distance and without comment. But at least for me, it’s in moments less intrinsically compelling, moments that would otherwise serve only the needs of exposition, that Keaton’s camera eye asserts its power  
most tellingly.

The plot requires, for example, Buster to discover that the girl he loved back East is a native of his own River Junction. Since Keaton seldom resists the chance to exploit the peculiarly filmic capacity for turning the most ordinary locale into the site of discovery, he places the crucial encounter in a barber’s shop, where the identical white cloths that cover all customers set off faces with particular clarity, and where fixed equidistant chairs allow for all manner of spatial redefinition by means of camera placement. Buster occupies his chair at the left of the frame, the girl hers at the right; each sits with head lowered, each faces right. On and on they sit, oblivious of each other, as two barbers administer to them. Then one barber reverses the position of the girl’s chair: at last they are face to face. But their eyes remain lowered; what’s more, the new position even increases the distance between their faces. Yet we know that, late or soon, one or the other of them must lift an eye. The absurdity of their common unconsciousness assumes dramatic tension. Distinctions between gag and plot and visual composition are effaced.

Later, Buster arrives on a visit to his imprisoned father. Ernest Torrence, behind bars, writhing at the very sight of his own son, dominates the left foreground. In the middle ground, seen through the bars, stands the jailer, separating father and son in the depth of space precisely as in his professional function. In the background, framed in the doorway to the right, the light from outdoors setting him off with agonising clarity, stands a creature no father could acknowledge as his own: Buster in an ill-fitting work suit that dwarfs him utterly, an upturned umbrella looming above his head. Here once again the picture is the drama: with its three distinct planes so forcefully defined by the foreground bars and background wall, the shot exploits the depth of cinematic space as cannily as any in the Toland-Welles-Wyler canon.

Keaton takes pleasure in other kinds of pictures as well, as when the wind blows the bedridden Buster through town. Placed dead centre in the long-shot frame, sitting bolt upright in the bed that only a moment before seemed safely moored in a hospital, he finds himself the object of scrutiny on the part of an odd new audience: on either side of him bemused horses gaze from their stalls at the prodigy that has just manifested itself in their stable. Unlike the images in the barber’s shop and jail, this lunatic version of a traditional Nativity performs no specific errand for Keaton’s plot. It is merely ideal of its kind.<br>
