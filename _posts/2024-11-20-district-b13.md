_+ intro by Chee Keong Cheung, writer, director, producer and CEO of  
Action Xtreme (Wednesday 20 November only)_

This dystopian actioner follows the same blueprint as the earlier _Taxi_: a cop and a civilian team-up in an uneasy partnership to try and stop a team of criminals. This time, instead of car-chases there is parkour, with one of the key pioneers of the discipline, David Belle, pairing his jaw-dropping abilities with the martial artistry of Cyril Raffaelli. It’s a lightning-paced thrill-ride that had a huge influence on the action genre and inspired that chase in _Casino Royale_.  
**Dick Fiddy, bfi.org.uk**  

Set in a walled-off urban hellhole that must be penetrated in order to complete a deadline-based mission, Pierre Morel’s _District 13_ owes an overt debt to John Carpenter’s _Escape from New York_. That it cannot easily be dismissed as a rehash of Carpenter’s film is largely due to its dynamic displays of the French cultural phenomenon ‘le parkour’ (also known as ‘free running’). Defined in the press notes as ‘a philosophy of action-based movement in an urban environment in which objects such as buildings are obstacles to be scaled rather than circumvented’, _le parkour_ has previously been showcased in 2001’s _Yamakasi_ (produced by Luc Besson, who also produces and co-writes this), the documentary _Jump London_ and a series of 2002 BBC idents featuring the concept’s inventor, David Belle.

Belle it is who plays _District_ _13_’s hero, Leïto, who teams up with Cyril Raffaelli’s police officer to track down the neutron bomb threatening the lawless ghetto of the film’s title. Stunt expert Raffaelli previously appeared in _Taxi 2_ (2000) and _Kiss of the Dragon_ (2001), both co-produced by Besson. _District 13_ is primarily a vehicle for the pair’s remarkable physical prowess, giving them ample opportunity to jump across rooftops, swing from balconies and squeeze through tiny gaps with the fluid grace of acrobats (Raffaelli is a circus veteran) and the limitless stamina of video game icons. Both get thrilling solo set-pieces early on in the film (an extended foot chase followed by a casino bust) before they team up to find the supposedly stolen bomb.

Driving the techno-scored action along at an almost overwhelming pace, first-time director Morel (a former camera operator) tries to make room for a little social commentary. While displaying a faith in the law, or at least the law as embodied by rubber-limbed individualists, the film takes a cynical view of the French government, which is ultimately revealed as the villain of the piece. (Co-writer Larbi ‘Bibi’ Naceri makes a good fist of his role as ostensible bad guy Taha, a droll drug lord who goes out in a _Scarface_-style hail of bullets.) Following France’s recent wave of riots, the images of Parisian lawlessness have a certain resonance beyond their dramatic function. Yet this is no _La Haine_-style meditation on life in the _banlieue_. Emblematic of _District_ _13_’s cursory class politics is the speeded-up tracking shot at the start that sketches out the setting’s pervasive squalor but doesn’t dwell on it. Meanwhile, Belle’s closing lecture to the corrupt politician who plotted _District_ _13_’s annihilation ‘violence isn’t the only way to solve problems’ – rings hollow after more than 70 minutes of problem-solving by feet, fists and firepower.

But judged in terms of spectacle, _District 13_ is a success. Morel makes occasional use of slow motion during the fight scenes, but doesn’t rely much on flashy editing, CGI or stunt doubles. The result is close to Prachya Pinkaew’s _Ong-Bak_, which Besson re-edited for international release and whose brutal authenticity provided a refreshing antidote to the ‘wire-fu’ balletics of post-_Matrix_ action cinema. But whereas _Ong-Bak_ was saddled with a slow first act, this has next to no downtime; it crashes through its crisply choreographed chain of pursuits, scraps and shoot-outs with single-minded exhilaration. Subtleties of plot, character and acting (the leads rip through their dialogue) fall by the wayside. Action fans won’t mind the trade-off.
