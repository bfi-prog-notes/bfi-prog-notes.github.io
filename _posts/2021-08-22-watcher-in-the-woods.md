**What’s it about?**

Disney’s supernatural family thriller sees an American family move into a manor in the English countryside. The owner (Davis) now lives in a house next door and notices a resemblance between one of the girls and her own daughter, who disappeared from a chapel in the local woods 30 years earlier. Soon the children become aware of strange goings on in the woods and find themselves in the middle of a spooky adventure.<br>

**The Watcher in the Woods**<br>
In Disney’s cult fantasy _The Watcher in the Woods_ the Curtis family – Helen (Carroll Baker), Paul (David McCallum) and their daughters Jan (Lynn-Holly Johnson) and Ellie (Kyle Richards) – take up residence in a country pile owned by the irascible Mrs Aylwood (Bette Davis). As it turns out, Aylwood’s daughter Karen disappeared 30 years ago, and the matriarch’s stern visage is softened by Jan’s resemblance to her missing child. Through a series of uncanny events involving circles of blue light, near-fatal accidents and disturbing visions of the absent daughter, Jan comes to understand the truth behind her doppelgänger’s disappearance.

Based on a 1976 novel by Florence Engel Randall, and directed by English journeyman John Hough, _The Watcher in the Woods_ is a beautifully shot, well-acted (21-year-old Johnson is especially terrific) curio, an oddball artefact from the period in Disney’s history when the studio was making a bid for relevance in the post-_Star Wars_ landscape of mainstream cinema. This period also produced cult favourites such as _The Black Hole_ and _Tron_, but neither of those can boast the decidedly troubled history – nor the eerie atmosphere – of this production.

Unhappy with its initial reception, Disney recalled the film and embarked on a tortuous process of rewrites (there were reportedly 152 possible conclusions in the running) and reshoots that resulted in two variant endings, one of which made the final cut while the other, which was to utilise special effects to create an alien world, remained unfinished. Meanwhile, tales abound of tension on the set involving an irritable Bette Davis, nervous executives and an embattled director.<br>
