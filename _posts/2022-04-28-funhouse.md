**SPOILER WARNING** The following notes give away some of the plot.

If you want to understand Tobe Hooper’s relationship to and impact on the horror genre, you could do worse than watching one of his very finest films, 1981’s _The Funhouse_. After an opening credits overture of creepy, chattering midway animatronics, we move into a young horror buff’s suburban bedroom, decorated with Halloween masks, posters celebrating the Universal Studios monsters, and rubber spiders. This is just the beginning of Hooper’s piling on of horror clichés: there’s a stalker POV that leads to a buxom young woman in the shower, à la _Psycho_, resolved as a harmless prank assassination with a rubber knife, and then a lot of business revolving around a visit to a fun fair and a carnival dark ride – all as if to say ‘Can you believe anyone used to get spooked at this kids’ stuff?’

But then one of the carnies loses his rubber Frankenstein mask to reveal a cleft-palated homicidal abomination beneath, and suddenly the movie loses the tired trappings of the classic horror and becomes a horror film in the Tobe Hooper mould, which is to say an excruciating ordeal, a predator-versus-prey fight for survival that is totally, terribly absorbed in the adrenaline-fuelled, propulsive panic of the moment.

Between _The Texas Chainsaw Massacre_, _Eaten Alive_ and _The Funhouse_, certain Hooper signatures emerge. In each, the rule of the jungle is tantamount: it’s either beat a retreat, or be eaten. His through-the-grinder style lent itself to condensed timelines, and the better part of each of the above films takes place through the course of a single harrowing night. (It should be noted, though, that before the carnage begins, _The Funhouse_ carries itself nicely as a loose, amiable portrait of smalltown teenage time-wasting.)

Beginning with the gristly geegaws filling the Sawyer family home and abattoir in _The Texas Chainsaw Massacre_, Hooper showed himself a diligent do-it-yourself world-builder, particularly interested in the fetid, out-of-the-way spaces created and maintained by dysfunctional individuals or families with lots and lots of time on their hands – the claustrophobic purpose-built Starlight Hotel set in _Eaten Alive_, or the carnival attraction maintained by the father and son in _The Funhouse_, whose relationship dynamic is quite close to that between  _The Texas Chain Saw Massacre_’s hulking, tantrum-prone Leatherface and his abusive keepers. Hooper had a knack for envisaging environments as organic outgrowths of diseased minds, and Ridley Scott, less a natural-born filmmaker in every possible regard, credited _The Texas Chain Saw Massacre_ as an inspiration on his own H.R. Giger-designed _Alien_ (1979).

_The Funhouse_, for Universal, was Hooper’s first studio feature film, made when his stock had been climbing steadily in the years since the immense profitability of _The Texas Chain Saw Massacre_ had put the ol’ Austin shit-kicker on Hollywood’s radar. For Warner Bros Television and ABC he did commendable work on the two-part 1979 miniseries adaptation of _Salem’s Lot_, based on a novel by Stephen King, then well on his way to household recognition, and followed _The Funhouse_ with _Poltergeist_ (1982), which would be the second legitimate pop cultural phenomenon of his then still-young career.

The inconsistent quality of even Hooper’s peak output has sometimes confounded his most ardent admirers, but this is concomitant to his volatile tone-mixing method, a dangerous technique which produced films that were awful or great, but rarely indifferent. And when Hooper did reach greatness, which he did more times than all but a few of us can hope for, there were very few better – his was one of the great creative acts of destruction.

**A contemporary review**  
The cinematic intelligence of Tobe Hooper, who radically made over the horror genre in _The Texas Chain Saw Massacre_, is reasserted with _The Funhouse_.  
In _Chain Saw_, Hooper dealt with parallel families – one ‘normal’ and one ‘abnormal’ – and with how a displacement of dignity led to dementia. It also featured the Gothic idea of a terrible house in which human evil is objectified, centralised and visited on those who stray within – which is the explicit basis of _The Funhouse_ as well. Here lighting and sets pay homage to all those low-budget screamies set in fairgrounds and carnivals, to the recent work of Dario Argento (_Suspiria_, _Inferno_), and to _Alien_ (the film’s finale builds in the wind tunnels and machine-shop bowels of the Funhouse, and the mutant is an albino Alien). But the way in which the setting is exploited belongs to  
Hooper alone.

Again as in _Chain Saw_, the film’s real focus is on the family and, through it, on the ‘permissive’ society. Over and over, we see how the ‘monstrous’ (and once more all-male) family – the source of the evil – is sustained and regenerated by exterminating (in _Chain Saw_, actually devouring) the threat of the outsider. The viewer is unable to disassociate himself from the mutant family, because the basic emotional ties between its father and son are made more recognisable and familiar than those between the ‘normal’ family – whose parents sit and quarrel over Mom’s drinking while son and daughter run wild. The coherence of these parallel family portraits – which build towards a Dorian Gray-style scream of Freudian recognition as the permissive society confronts its true self – is due in part to Hooper’s invention (cunning use of Dolby sound to convey telling snatches of conversation subtly and, inside the Funhouse, to use aural shock from every angle, just as every corner of the frame is exploited visually).

But equally important is his traditional method of architecting each film as one long, relentless build of tension. Which sounds as puritanical as Hooper’s equally relentless morality – except that _The Funhouse_ is spiked with the same sort of irresistibly anarchic and black humour as _Chain Saw_ and _Death Trap_, right up to a _tour de force_ finale which literally transforms the monster at the moment of his death into an exhibit before our eyes – watched by a distraught but still fascinated Amy, a stand-in for our own voyeurism, just as all the mechanically laughing exhibits have been throughout the film. Far from being an exemplar of overwhelming nihilism, _The Funhouse_ is an eminently satisfying piece of film work.
