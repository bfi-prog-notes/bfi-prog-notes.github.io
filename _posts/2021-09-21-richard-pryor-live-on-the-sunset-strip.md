In his return to the stage after a highly publicised, drugged-fuelled accident, Pryor somehow outdoes himself, oscillating between some of his best-loved riffs and characters and a confessional mode as he lays bare many of his demons, from his relationships with women to his struggle with addiction.<br>

**Contemporary review**<br>
Richard Pryor, fully recovered from last year’s serious accident, is filmed in two stand-up comic performances at the Hollywood Palladium, Los Angeles.

Pryor may have returned from his near-fatal accident somewhat mellowed, but aficionados of _Richard Pryor Live in Concert_ should not be let down by his latest batch of comic routines. His new-found ‘wisdom’, characterised by the excision from his vocabulary of the word ‘nigger’ and the clearly influential experience of a visit to Africa (‘Where we all come from, man’), conceivably sets a new tone. But the wit is as sharp as ever, and there is no sense of this supremely accomplished social/sexual satirist having gone soft. Indeed, the finer points of his acting (recreating a youthful encounter with the Mafia in which he uses the microphone stand as his imaginary persona, mimicking the behaviour of cheetahs and gazelles in an African game park) are quintessential demonstrations of the power of body language to amuse. Pryor could be as entertaining as any mime artist if that alone were the extent of his repertoire. But when he overlays such antics with his unique scatological monologues, the result can leave audiences (and reviewers) helpless with laughter.

Attempting, in the face of this attack, to essay some critical assessment of the roles of director Joe Layton and cameraman Haskell Wexler is not easy, but the cinematography is never less than adequate and the cutting is precise enough to elide two different performances without losing their sly postscripts. What matters, however, is the act itself, with all its verbal detours and physical illustration to which no written account could do justice. Suffice to say that the funniest routines are probably the Mafia story, the animal observations, and a frank discussion of his narcotics addiction (which led to his inadvertently setting fire to himself and suffering severe burns). At the close of the performance, he takes a match from a member of the audience, strikes it and asks, ‘What’s that?’ – ‘Richard Pryor running down the street’ he replies to his own question, and adds, ‘I know all that shit you been saying about me while I was away’. But Pryor is back, triumphantly, in his place as the most socially astute, sex-conscious, blasphemous and sublime solo act in show-business.<br>
