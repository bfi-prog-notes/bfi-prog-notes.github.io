This wide-ranging exploration of the roots, context and legacy of Italian neorealism is the perfect starting point for our two-month long programme. Join season curator Giulia Saccogna together with film critic Christina Newland and academics Professor Richard Dyer and Professor Stephen Gundle for a richly illustrated conversation looking at some of the key figures behind the movement, the newly emerging portrayal of women in Italian cinema in the post-war era, and the stylistic elements and thematic preoccupations that made the movement so influential.

**Richard Dyer** is Professor Emeritus at King’s College London. His books include _Stars_, _White_, _Nino Rota_ and, in the BFI Classics series, _Brief Encounter_, _Se7en_ and _La dolce vita_. _The Richard Dyer Reader_, edited by Glyn Davis and Jaap Kooijman, was published last year.

**Stephen Gundle** teaches film and television studies at the University of Warwick. He has written widely about Italian cinema and cultural history. Among his books are _Bellissima: Feminine Beauty and the Idea of Italy_ (2007), _Mussolini's Dream Factory: Film Stardom in Fascist Italy_ (2013) and _Fame Amid the Ruins: Italian Film Stardom in the Age of Neorealism_ (2020). He is currently directing a collaborative research project on the role of women in the Italian film industry between the 1940s and 1980s.

**Christina Newland** is the lead film critic at the _i_ Newspaper and contributing editor at _Empire Magazine_, with bylines at BBC, Criterion, _Little White Lies_, and many others.

**(Host) Giulia Saccogna** is Programme & Research Coordinator at BFI Southbank and curator of the season ‘Chasing the Real: Italian Neorealism’, running through May and June at BFI Southbank.
