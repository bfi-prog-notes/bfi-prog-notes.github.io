Learning-disability film culture is rich with ideas, stories and imagination. But with less than 5% of disabled people working in the UK film industry, getting the work made and seen is a challenge. Oska Bright Film Festival, the world’s leading platform for learning-disability films and filmmakers, is dedicated to celebrating this vibrant art form and increasing representation. This screening of shorts, specially curated for BFI by lead programmer Matthew Hellett, gives a flavour of the range of talent that Oska Bright hosts. Enjoy some festival favourites from the most recent edition which takes place in Brighton and across the UK in March.

Before the screenings begin we will show a pre-recorded introduction from Matthew Hellett, Lead Programmer for Oska Bright Film Festival. We hope to welcome some of the film-makers to the screening.
