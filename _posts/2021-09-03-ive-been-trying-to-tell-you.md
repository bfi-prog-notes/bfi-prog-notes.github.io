_+ Q&A with Alasdair McLellan and Bob Stanley_

Do you look back on the optimism of the 1997-2001 era as a lost golden age, or do you see it as a period of naïvety, delusion and folly? There’s a lot of nostalgia for the nineties at the moment, especially from people too young to remember it who see the decade as a simpler, pre-internet time. Modern nostalgia often draws on corporate American-90s mall culture, but what about British culture? With _I’ve Been Trying to Tell You_ – made to accompany the Saint Etienne album of the same name – director Alasdair McLellan evokes the era through the fog of memory. The resulting film, shot in locations from Grangemouth to Portmeirion to Southampton, is both beautiful and enveloping.

**Saint Etienne**

Saint Etienne released their first single, ‘Only Love Can Break Your Heart’, on Heavenly Recordings in 1990. They followed it with the Mercury Music Prize-nominated _Foxbase Alpha_ and, through the 1990s, they were chart regulars, earning three gold discs (for the _Foxbase Alpha_, _So Tough_ and _Too Young to Die_ albums), scoring 11 Top 40 hits (including ‘You’re in a Bad Way’, ‘Who Do You Think You Are’ and ‘He’s on the Phone’) and appearing six times on  
_Top of the Pops_. The _Guardian_ have described them as ‘London’s musical laureates… perhaps the only band to capture the teeming variety of  
the capital.’

Bob Stanley and Pete Wiggs have known each other since childhood and first entered a recording studio in 1988, inspired by the invention of samplers and the Acid House explosion. Bob was writing for the _New Musical Express_ at the time; Pete was the more technically minded, and started to assemble a home studio with vintage analogue equipment.

They met Windsor-raised singer Sarah Cracknell two years later. She had been in a variety of indie bands, but her instantly recognisable, very English voice was perfectly suited to Stanley and Wiggs’ songs. The trio soon began to write together. As they were recording the _Finisterre_ album in 2002, they decided to make a film to go with it, in collaboration with their regular video director  
Paul Kelly. They had long been intrigued by London’s geography and complex history, and both film and album documented the city at a specific moment early in the 21st century. They continue to write and produce the scores for each Paul Kelly/Saint Etienne project.
