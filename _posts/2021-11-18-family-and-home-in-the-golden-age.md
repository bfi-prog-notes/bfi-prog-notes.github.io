The various spaces of the Japanese home provide one of the most inviting aspects of classical Japanese cinema. Join Professor Alastair Phillips (University of Warwick) to examine the changing representation of familial relations and domestic life in several key films screening during our season. This wide-ranging and richly illustrated talk will combine historical context with clips, and offer an opportunity for audience engagement.
