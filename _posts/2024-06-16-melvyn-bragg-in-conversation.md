Over the course of an incredible 60-year broadcasting career, Melvyn Bragg has unfailingly championed the arts on television. More than this, he has revolutionised the way the arts are presented and perceived on the small screen, harnessing the power of ITV to reach a wider and more diverse audience. In treating popular culture with the same weight and attention as more established artistic practices, he has broken down barriers and provided immense insight into all spheres of the arts for a wide and highly appreciative audience. Illustrated with clips from across a unique career, this interview with Lord Bragg celebrates his enormous influence and rich legacy.

**Melvyn Bragg** was born in Wigton, Cumbria, and was educated there and at Wadham College, Oxford.

His broadcasting career began at the BBC in 1961 and soon afterwards he published his first novel. He worked on the arts programme _Monitor_ with Huw Wheldon in the mid-1960s; during this time he began writing novels, set mostly in his native Cumbria. He collaborated with Ken Russell and wrote the 1970 film about Tchaikovsky, _The Music Lovers_. He also wrote _Isadora_, directed by Karel Reisz, _Play Dirty_ starring Michael Caine, worked with David Lean, and with Howard Goodall wrote the musical version of his novel _The Hired Man_ which was first published in 1969.

In 1977 Melvyn started LWT’s long-running Arts programme, the multiple award-winning _South Bank Show_, making about 800 editions as well as other documentaries. The programme was de-commissioned in 2010, when he took the programme across to Sky Arts. ‘_The South Bank Show_ lives again’, he said at the time. As well as _The South Bank Show_, Sky Arts now does 30 editions a year of _The South Bank Show Originals_.

In the meantime Melvyn has expanded his range, presenting arts and science programmes and marshalling discussion shows on BBC Radio (on _In Our Time_), and writing non-fiction books including _The Adventure of English_ and _The Impact of The King James Bible_ as well as _On Giants’ Shoulders_, a series about the history of science. He has also written several award-winning novels – _The Soldier’s Return_, _The Maid of Buttermere_, _Remember Me_, _Now Is the Time_ (Parliamentary Book Award 2016) – and most recently _Back in the Day_.

He is an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society and of The British Academy. He was given a Peerage in 1998 and a Companion of Honour in 2017. He is a member of Chelsea Arts Club and The Garrick.
